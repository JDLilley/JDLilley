Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament about a bill that would abolish the child trust fund, a savings scheme for children. The opposition argues that the fund promotes saving, financial education and social mobility, while the government claims that it is wasteful, ineffective and unaffordable.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the amendment that would delete clause 1 of the bill and preserve the child trust fund. It means valuing the long-term benefits of the fund for children, especially those from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the amendment and backing the government's plan to scrap the child trust fund. It means prioritising fiscal responsibility and reducing public debt, as well as questioning the evidence and impact of the fund.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is more associated with stimulus and the free market, as it implies favouring more government spending and intervention to boost saving and investment, as well as giving more choice and opportunity to individuals.

Sentiment - A
