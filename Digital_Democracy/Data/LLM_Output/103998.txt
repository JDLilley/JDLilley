Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Treaty of Lisbon, which aimed to reform the EU institutions and decision-making. The debate focused on the institutional changes, the role of national parliaments, and the extension of qualified majority voting.

For - The supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon argued that it would make the EU more effective, transparent, and accountable, and that it would benefit the UK's interests in areas such as trade, energy, and security. They also claimed that the treaty respected the sovereignty of national parliaments and did not create a US-style president.

Against - The opponents of the Treaty of Lisbon contended that it would erode the UK's sovereignty and democracy, and that it would transfer more powers to the EU without the consent of the British people. They also criticised the lack of a referendum on the treaty and the complexity and ambiguity of its provisions.

Decision - The Treaty of Lisbon (No. 7), Main Question put forthwith would soften immigration and borders, as it would enhance the EU's role in developing a common policy on asylum, immigration, and external border control, and facilitate the free movement of persons within the EU.

Sentiment - B
