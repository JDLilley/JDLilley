Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Climate Change Bill, which aims to set legally binding targets and budgets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The debate covers various aspects of the Bill, such as international aviation and shipping, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government amendments to the Bill, which include: setting an 80 per cent. reduction target for 2050; requiring the Committee on Climate Change to advise on the consequences of including international aviation and shipping emissions; allowing the Secretary of State to amend the 2020 target in light of significant developments in European or international law or policy; and introducing a new clause on carbon capture and storage incentive schemes.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Government amendments to the Bill, which some MPs argue are insufficient, inconsistent, or impractical. Some of the criticisms are: the 80 per cent. target is too low and should be raised to 90 per cent.; international aviation and shipping emissions should be included in the targets and budgets from the outset; the Secretary of State should not have the power to alter the 2020 target without parliamentary approval; and the new clause on carbon capture and storage is vague and does not guarantee any funding or regulation.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with prioritising environmental sustainability in the context of Environment & Energy, as it supports a more ambitious and comprehensive approach to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Government amendments reflect the recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change, which is an independent body of experts that advises on the scientific, economic, and social aspects of climate change.

Sentiment - A
