Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Treaty of Lisbon, a reform of the EU institutions and policies. The debate focuses on the implications of the treaty for international development, trade, humanitarian aid and foreign policy.

For - The supporters of the amendment argue that the Treaty of Lisbon will strengthen the EU's development cooperation by ensuring that aid is used to reduce poverty, humanitarian aid is allocated on the basis of need and non-aid policies take account of development objectives. They also claim that the treaty will enhance the efficiency, democratic legitimacy and coherence of the EU's external action.

Against - The opponents of the amendment contend that the Treaty of Lisbon will undermine the UK's sovereignty and control over its own development policy. They also express concerns that the treaty will subsume development under foreign policy, remove references to the most disadvantaged countries and fail to reform the EU's trade and agricultural policies.

Decision - The Treaty of Lisbon (No. 6), That the amendment be made will likely soften immigration and borders, as it will promote a more integrated and coordinated approach to external relations among the EU member states. It will also facilitate the movement of people and goods within the EU single market and enhance the EU's role in addressing global challenges such as poverty, conflict and climate change.

Sentiment - B
