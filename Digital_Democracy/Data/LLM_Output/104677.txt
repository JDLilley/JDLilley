Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate on a bill that proposes to change the voting system and the size of constituencies in the UK. The bill aims to make elections more fair and legitimate, but faces opposition from some MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the amendment that would delay the referendum on the voting system until October 2011, instead of May 2011. The amendment argues that holding the referendum on the same day as other elections would confuse voters and undermine its importance.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the amendment and keeping the referendum date as May 2011. The argument is that holding the referendum on the same day as other elections would increase turnout, save money, and avoid further delay in reforming the political system.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in this division is associated with accountability and decentralisation in the context of Parliamentary Procedures, because it implies that the referendum should be held separately from other elections to ensure that voters have a clear choice and a proper debate on the voting system. It also suggests that the bill should be scrutinised more carefully by Parliament before being put to a public vote.

Sentiment - A
