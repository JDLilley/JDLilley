Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the timetable and procedure for scrutinising the European Union (Amendment) Bill, which implements the Lisbon Treaty in the UK.

For - The supporters of the motion argue that it is a straightforward and procedural motion that will ensure a structured, themed and comprehensive debate on the Bill, covering a range of issues arising from the Lisbon Treaty.

Against - The opponents of the motion contend that it is unnecessary and restrictive, as it limits the debate to 10 o'clock on a Monday and excludes other amendments and topics that are not on the Government's list. They also accuse the Government of alienating the public and some of their allies by imposing the motion.

Decision - The motion does not directly affect immigration and borders, as it is only about the timetable and procedure for scrutinising the Bill. However, if the motion is passed, it could indirectly soften immigration and borders by facilitating the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which enhances the EU's role and competence in those areas.

Sentiment - B
