Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the timetable for scrutinising the European Union (Amendment) Bill, which implements the Lisbon Treaty in the UK. The debate took place on 28 January 2008.

For - The Government argued that the motion was necessary to ensure a structured, themed and comprehensive debate on the Bill, covering a range of issues arising from the Lisbon Treaty[1][2]. They also claimed that the motion was procedural and straightforward.

Against - The Opposition and some backbenchers criticised the motion as unnecessary, restrictive and designed to limit debate on the Bill. They also questioned the Government's selection of themes and accused them of alienating the public and their allies.

Decision - The Business of the House (Lisbon Treaty), Main Question put would not directly affect immigration and borders, as it was only about the procedure for debating the Bill. However, indirectly, it could be seen as a way of facilitating the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which would have implications for immigration and borders in the EU. The Lisbon Treaty aimed to strengthen the EU's common policies on asylum, migration and border control, as well as to enhance cooperation with third countries on those matters. Therefore, voting for (Ayes) in the division could be interpreted as a step towards softening immigration and borders in the UK, while voting against (Noes) could be seen as a resistance to that.

Sentiment - B
