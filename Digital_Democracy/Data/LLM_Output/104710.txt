Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill that proposes a referendum on changing the voting system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote. The amendment 353 would require the votes to be counted by parliamentary constituency instead of local authority.

For - Voting 'Ayes' for amendment 353 means supporting the idea that the referendum results should be reported by parliamentary constituency, which is the same unit used for electing MPs. This would provide more clarity and consistency for the voters and the public.

Against - Voting 'Noes' for amendment 353 means opposing the idea that the referendum results should be counted by parliamentary constituency, which would add extra costs and complexity to the counting process. This would delay the announcement of the result and create unnecessary divisions within the UK.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' for amendment 353 is associated with accountability and decentralisation in the context of parliamentary procedures, because it would allow the voters to see how their constituency voted in the referendum and how it compares to other constituencies. It would also give more weight to the local preferences and opinions of the voters.
