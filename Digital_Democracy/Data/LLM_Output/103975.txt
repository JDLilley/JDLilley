Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Treaty of Lisbon, which aimed to reform the EU institutions and policies. The debate focused on the impact of the treaty on the single market, competition, public services and health care.

For - Those who voted for the treaty argued that it would strengthen the UK's position in the EU, enhance the benefits of the single market, protect the national health system and public services, and promote jobs and growth.

Against - Those who voted against the treaty claimed that it would weaken the UK's sovereignty, undermine free and undistorted competition, expose public services and health care to privatisation and marketisation, and harm the UK's competitiveness and social model.

Decision - The Treaty of Lisbon would not have a direct effect on immigration and borders, as it did not change the existing provisions on free movement of persons, asylum and border control. However, it could be argued that it would indirectly soften immigration and borders by enhancing the role of the EU in developing a common policy on immigration and asylum, and by increasing the UK's obligations to cooperate with other member states and EU agencies on border management.

Sentiment - B
