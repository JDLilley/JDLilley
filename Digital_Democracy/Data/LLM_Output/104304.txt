Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Business Rate Supplements Bill, which allows local authorities to raise additional funds from businesses for infrastructure projects. The debate focuses on the programme motion that sets the time limit for the discussion.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the programme motion and agreeing to the proposed timetable for the Bill. The 'Ayes' argue that the Bill has been well debated and properly scrutinised in the Committee stage, and that it gives local authorities more flexibility and autonomy to invest in their areas.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the programme motion and requesting more time for the debate. The 'Noes' argue that the Bill is a nasty and spiteful measure that imposes an extra burden on businesses during difficult times, and that it deserves full and proper consideration by the House.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it supports the idea of raising funds from businesses to finance infrastructure projects that could boost economic growth and competitiveness. It also reflects a preference for local decision making and less central control.

Sentiment - A
