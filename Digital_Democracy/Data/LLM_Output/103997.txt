Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Treaty of Lisbon, which amends the EU treaties to make the EU more effective and accountable. The debate covers the institutional reforms and decision-making processes introduced by the treaty.

For - The supporters of the amendment argue that the Treaty of Lisbon is in the UK's national interest, as it enhances the role of national Parliaments, improves the efficiency and transparency of the EU institutions, and strengthens the EU's ability to address global challenges such as trade, climate change, and security.

Against - The opponents of the amendment claim that the Treaty of Lisbon is a constitutional change that requires a referendum, as it transfers more powers and sovereignty to the EU, creates a new president and foreign minister of the EU, and extends qualified majority voting to more areas.

Decision - The Treaty of Lisbon (No. 7), That the amendment be made would soften immigration and borders, as it would allow the EU to develop a common policy on asylum, immigration, and external border control, and to act in solidarity with member states facing migratory pressures.

Sentiment - B
