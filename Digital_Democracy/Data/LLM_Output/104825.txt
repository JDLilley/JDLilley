Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the local government finance report for England in 2011-12. The report sets out the funding allocation for councils and the criteria for capping council tax increases.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the report and the Government's policy of reducing the budget deficit by cutting public spending. It also means accepting the Government's claim that the report is fair, progressive and sustainable, and that councils can protect front-line services by using their reserves, cutting executive pay and sharing back offices.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the report and the Government's policy of imposing deep and fast cuts on local councils, especially the poorest ones. It also means rejecting the Government's claim that the report is fair, progressive and sustainable, and that councils can protect front-line services by using their reserves, cutting executive pay and sharing back offices.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in this division is associated with austerity and regulation, because it supports reducing public spending and limiting council tax increases.

Sentiment - B
