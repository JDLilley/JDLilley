Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the UK Borders Bill, which aims to reform the immigration system and strengthen border security. The Bill introduces new powers for immigration officers, new measures to tackle illegal working and human trafficking, and new biometric documents for foreign nationals[1].

For - The supporters of the Bill argue that it is necessary to modernise the immigration system and to protect the public from illegal immigration and organised crime. They claim that the Bill will provide more resources, technology and international co-operation to secure the borders and enforce the immigration laws.

Against - The opponents of the Bill criticise it for being ineffective, disproportionate and discriminatory. They question the evidence base, the cost and the human rights implications of the Bill. They also express concerns about the lack of oversight, accountability and safeguards for immigration officers and their powers.

Decision - The UK Borders Bill is intended to tighten immigration and borders by making it harder for people to enter and stay in the country illegally, and easier for the authorities to detect and remove them. The Bill also aims to deter illegal working and exploitation by introducing harsher penalties and biometric checks.

Sentiment - A
