Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the government's support for Northern Rock, a bank that faced financial difficulties in 2007. The debate covers the principles, options and implications of the government's intervention.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the government's approach to Northern Rock, which involves providing liquidity support, protecting the interests of taxpayers and depositors, and maintaining financial stability[1]. It also means agreeing to consider proposals from private buyers that meet these criteria[2].

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the government's approach to Northern Rock, which is seen as inadequate, costly and risky for the taxpayers. It also means favouring alternative solutions, such as nationalising the bank temporarily or letting it fail.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies that the government should intervene to prevent a bank failure that could have negative consequences for the economy, and that it should facilitate a private sale of the bank rather than taking it into public ownership.

Sentiment - A
