Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Business Rate Supplements Bill, which allows local authorities to raise additional funds from businesses for infrastructure projects. The debate covers the programme motion, which sets the time limit for the discussion, and the clause 1, which defines the scope of the bill.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the programme motion and the clause 1. It means agreeing with the Government that the bill is well debated and properly scrutinised, and that it will benefit businesses by improving local services and facilities.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the programme motion and the clause 1. It means disagreeing with the Government that the bill is adequately debated and examined, and that it will impose an unfair burden on businesses during difficult economic times.
