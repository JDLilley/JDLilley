Hello, this is Bing. I can help you review the text file open in your current webpage. Here is my response based on your request:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill that proposes an audit of the costs and benefits of the UK's membership in the European Union. The bill's sponsor, Mr. Christopher Chope, argues that the people deserve to know the facts and have a referendum on the issue. The bill is supported by several Conservative MPs who criticise the EU's policies, regulations, and lack of democracy. The bill is opposed by the Labour Government who claim that it is unnecessary, divisive, and damaging to the UK's interests.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the bill and calling for an independent commission to examine the impact of the EU membership on the UK's economy, security, and constitution. It also means favouring a renegotiation of the UK's relationship with the EU and giving the people a choice in a referendum.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means rejecting the bill and maintaining the status quo of the UK's membership in the EU. It also means trusting the Government's assessment of the costs and benefits of the EU membership and respecting the previous referendum result in 1975.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with protectionism and independence from the European Union and other foreign affairs. It reflects a sceptical and critical view of the EU's role and influence on the UK's sovereignty, economy, and security. It also implies a desire to reduce or withdraw from the EU's integration and co-operation processes.

Sentiment - B
