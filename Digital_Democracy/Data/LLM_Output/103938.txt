Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which covers various aspects of criminal justice, offender management and immigration law.

For - The MPs who voted for the programme motion supported the government's timetable for the bill, which would limit the time for debate and amendments at each stage. They argued that the bill was necessary to protect public safety, combat crime and disorder, and deal with immigration issues.

Against - The MPs who voted against the programme motion opposed the government's attempt to curtail the scrutiny of the bill, which they considered complex and controversial. They argued that the bill contained many flaws and needed more time for discussion and improvement. They also criticised the government for breaking its promises to prison officers.

Decision - The programme motion would tighten immigration and borders, as it would facilitate the passage of the bill, which contains provisions for a new immigration status in certain cases involving criminality, and for the early removal of prisoners from the UK.

Sentiment - A
