Hello, this is Bing. I have reviewed the text file open in your current webpage and I will try to answer your questions as best as I can. Here is my response:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the European Union (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to ratify the Lisbon Treaty. The debate focuses on whether a referendum should be held before the Bill comes into force.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the amendment No. 293 to clause 8, which would require a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty before the Bill can take effect. The supporters of the amendment argue that the Treaty is a major constitutional change that affects the sovereignty and democracy of the UK, and that the people have a right to have their say on it.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the amendment No. 293 to clause 8, which would require a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty before the Bill can take effect. The opponents of the amendment argue that the Treaty is not a constitutional change but a reform of the existing EU institutions, and that holding a referendum would be costly, divisive and unnecessary.

Decision - Voting 'Ayes' in the division is associated with protectionism and independence from the European Union and other Foreign Affairs, because it implies a distrust of the EU and a desire to preserve the UK's autonomy and control over its own affairs.

Sentiment - B
