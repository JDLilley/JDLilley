Here is my response based on your request:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the UK Borders Bill, which aims to improve the deportation of foreign criminals and the border security. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - The MPs who voted for (Ayes) in the division: UK Borders Bill supported the Government's intention to make deportation automatic for foreign nationals who commit serious offences and to enhance the powers of immigration officers and police to search for evidence of nationality.

Against - The MPs who voted against (Noes) in the division: UK Borders Bill opposed the Government's approach as disproportionate, unfair and ineffective. They argued that the Bill would violate human rights, create legal uncertainties, undermine community relations and fail to address the root causes of illegal immigration.

Decision - The UK Borders Bill would tighten immigration and borders, as it would increase the number of foreign nationals who would be subject to deportation and reduce the scope of exceptions and appeals. It would also give more authority and discretion to immigration officers and police to enforce immigration laws.

Sentiment - A
