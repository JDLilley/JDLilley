Here is my response based on your request:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Treaty of Lisbon, an agreement that amended the constitutional basis of the European Union. The debate focused on the implications of the treaty for international development, trade, foreign policy and democracy.

For - The supporters of the treaty argued that it would strengthen the EU's development assistance by ensuring that aid is used to reduce poverty, humanitarian aid is allocated on the basis of need and non-aid policies take account of development objectives. They also claimed that the treaty would improve coherence and coordination across the EU's external actions and enhance its role in tackling global challenges such as climate change, conflict and trade.

Against - The opponents of the treaty criticised it for giving more powers and money to the EU without adequate accountability and transparency. They also expressed concerns that the treaty would subsume international development under foreign policy and diplomacy, and undermine the UK's independent voice and influence in the world. They also questioned the effectiveness and efficiency of the EU's aid programmes and policies.

Decision - The Treaty of Lisbon (No. 6), Mr. Deputy Speaker put forthwith the Main Question, pursuant to Orders (28 January and this day) would not have a direct impact on immigration and borders, as it did not introduce any new provisions or changes in this area. However, it could be argued that it would indirectly soften immigration and borders by promoting a more integrated and coherent EU external action, which could facilitate cooperation and dialogue with third countries on migration issues, as well as enhancing the EU's capacity to respond to humanitarian crises and conflicts that could generate displacement and asylum seekers.

Sentiment - B
