A transcript of a debate in the House of Commons. The amendment in the name of the Leader of the Opposition was selected for debate and the Speaker selected the amendment in the name of Sir Menzies Campbell for voting purposes. 

Summary - The Chancellor's admission that we need a Bill to "enhance confidence in Government statistics" is welcomed, but the Bill falls far short of what was promised[1]. The Treasury claims to be establishing an independent statistics office, yet Ministers, not that independent office, will decide which statistics it can scrutinise and release[2]. The Audit Commission says that the Treasury's approach will "only seek to generate low public trust in statistics and reinforce the perception of political interference in the production and publication of statistics."[3]

For - For voting 'Ayes' in the division related to 'Treasury and Work and Pensions', it means that they support the amendment made by George Osborne which regrets that the Gracious Speech does not contain measures to address Britain's declining productivity growth since 1997; deplore the absence of measures to give the UK the right skills to take advantage of new global opportunities; further regret the absence of strong and binding measures to tackle climate change and environmental degradation; condemn the absence of measures to ensure real improvements in public services and greater value for money for taxpayers; and further regret the absence of measures in the Gracious Speech to tackle the pensions crisis to which Government policy has contributed.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division related to 'Treasury and Work and Pensions' means that they do not support George Osborne's amendment.

Decision - None given

Sentiment - C
