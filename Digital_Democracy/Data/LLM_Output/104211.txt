Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the economic crisis in 2008. The main topics are the banking rescue plan, the housing market, the tax cuts and the fiscal stimulus.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Liberal Democrat motion that calls for a substantial cut in income tax for low and middle income earners, paid for by wealthy individuals and tax reforms. It also criticises the Government and the banking industry for their failures.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Liberal Democrat motion and backing the Government amendment that notes the Government's actions to stabilise the global banking system, protect depositors and businesses, and support families and individuals through tax credits, fuel duty freeze and other measures.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it advocates for a reduction in income tax that would boost consumer spending and demand, and also for a more equitable tax system that would reduce the privileges of the financial sector.

Sentiment - A
