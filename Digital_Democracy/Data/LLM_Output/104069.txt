Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill in 2008. The Bill covers various aspects of criminal law, sentencing, and immigration policy. The debate focuses on the use of suspended sentences for summary offences[1].

For - The Government argues that suspended sentences are being used too often for minor offences that would not warrant custody, and that they blur the threshold for imprisonment. The Government claims that removing suspended sentences for summary offences would save prison places and encourage more community sentences.

Against - The Opposition and some peers argue that suspended sentences are a useful tool for the courts to deter and rehabilitate offenders, and that they should not be restricted for summary offences. They contend that the Government is trying to solve the prison overcrowding problem by reducing sentencing options, rather than building more prisons.

Decision - The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, Question put, That this House disagrees with the Lords amendment NÂº 173 would tighten immigration and borders, because the amendment would allow foreign nationals who are liable to deportation to appeal against their removal while remaining in the UK. The Government wants to remove this right of appeal and deport them first, then hear their appeal later.

Sentiment - A
