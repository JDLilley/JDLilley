Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government's motion to limit the time for debating the Bill. This would allow the Government to proceed with their reforms of legal aid and sentencing, which they claim are necessary to reduce costs, modernise the system and focus resources on the most serious cases.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Government's motion to limit the time for debating the Bill. This would allow more time for scrutiny and discussion of the amendments proposed by the House of Lords, which aim to protect access to justice, especially for vulnerable groups, and to preserve some areas of legal aid that the Government want to remove.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments and strengthening Crime & Justice. The Government's reforms of legal aid and sentencing would make it harder for some people to challenge the state or seek redress for wrongs, while increasing the use of mandatory sentences and reducing the discretion of judges.

Sentiment - A
