Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on a programme motion for the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill in 2023. The motion sets out the time limits for the remaining stages of the Bill.

Against - The Opposition and some backbenchers criticise the motion as an abuse of power and an affront to parliamentary democracy. They say the motion does not allow enough time to scrutinise the Bill, which has been vastly expanded and amended since its introduction. They say the motion denies the House its role in debating criminal law.
