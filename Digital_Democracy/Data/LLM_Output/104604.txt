Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on higher education policy in 2010. The main topics are university funding, tuition fees, student support, and social mobility.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's amendment, which commends its record of investment in higher education, increasing participation and diversity of students, providing high levels of student support, and expanding the range of pathways and opportunities to higher education.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's amendment and backing the Opposition's motion, which criticises the Government's plans to reduce the number of undergraduate places, calls for more university places funded by offering a discount for early repayment of student loans, and demands more apprenticeships, training places, and careers advice.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with increased Education & Learning, because it recognises the achievements and aspirations of the Government to provide more resources, access, and quality to higher education. It also supports the ongoing review of higher education funding by Lord Browne, which aims to ensure a sustainable and fair system for the future.

Sentiment - A
