Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the economy and the Government's policies to tackle the recession. The Opposition criticises the Government for failing to implement its schemes, running up huge debts, and not reforming the regulatory system. The Government defends its actions and accuses the Opposition of having no credible alternative.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government's amendment, which praises its fiscal stimulus, its support for businesses and households, its international leadership, and its commitment to long-term stability and fairness. It also rejects the Opposition's motion, which it claims would worsen the recession and damage public services.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means supporting the Opposition's motion, which condemns the Government for not delivering on its promises, having the largest budget deficit in the developed world, and not addressing the causes of the crisis. It also calls on the Government to implement its schemes, to help savers and small businesses, and to reform the tax system, the regulation, and the public sector.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with stimulus and regulation, as the Government advocates increasing public spending and borrowing to boost demand and strengthen oversight of the financial sector. Voting 'Noe' in the division is associated with austerity and free market, as the Opposition argues for reducing public expenditure and debt, and for lowering taxes and barriers to business.

Sentiment - A
