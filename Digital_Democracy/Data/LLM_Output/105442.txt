Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill that would require a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union by 2017. The bill was introduced by a Conservative MP and supported by most of his party, but opposed by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the bill and giving the British people a choice on whether to stay in or leave the EU. It means trusting the public to decide on a fundamental issue that affects the UK's sovereignty, economy, and democracy. It also means backing the Prime Minister's plan to renegotiate a better deal with the EU before the referendum.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the bill and denying the British people a say on their relationship with the EU. It means fearing the outcome of a referendum and preferring the status quo of EU integration. It also means undermining the Prime Minister's authority and credibility in his negotiations with the EU.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with protectionism and independence from the EU and other foreign affairs. It reflects a desire to reclaim national sovereignty and control over laws, borders, and trade. It also implies a scepticism or hostility towards the EU's policies, institutions, and values.

Sentiment - B
