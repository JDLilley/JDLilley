The debate covers various aspects and implications of the bill, such as its scope, effectiveness, fairness and urgency.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the bill and its measures to protect the rights and revenues of content creators and providers. It also means accepting the government's argument that the bill is necessary and urgent to address the challenges and opportunities of the digital economy.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the bill and its measures to restrict the access and activities of internet users and service providers.
