For - The supporters of the amendment argue that the Treaty of Lisbon is irrelevant or harmful for advancing the cause of climate change policy[1]. They claim that the treaty does not provide any new powers or mechanisms for the EU to tackle climate change effectively, and that it undermines national sovereignty and democracy.

They claim that the treaty provides a clear legal basis and competence for the EU to act on climate change, and that it enhances cooperation and coordination among member states and with other countries[2].
