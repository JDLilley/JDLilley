Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the European Union (Amendment) Bill, which aimed to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon. The debate focused on the implications of changing the terminology from European Communities to European Union.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the amendment proposed by Mr. Heathcoat-Amory, which would require any changes of terminology or numbering arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon to be approved by both Houses of Parliament, instead of using the negative procedure.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the amendment and accepting the Government's proposal to use the negative procedure for making changes of terminology or numbering arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon, which would give more power to the Secretary of State or the Treasury.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with protectionism and independence from the European Union and other Foreign Affairs, because it reflects a distrust of the Government's ability to make changes without parliamentary scrutiny and a desire to preserve national sovereignty and control over EU matters.

Sentiment - B
