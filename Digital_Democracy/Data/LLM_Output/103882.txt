Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill in 2023. The Bill covers various topics such as sentencing, self-defence, hate crimes, and immigration status.

For - The supporters of the Bill argue that it is necessary to update the law to respond to changing circumstances, such as new technologies, public demands, and social issues. They claim that the Bill will protect the public from violent and dangerous offenders, enhance the rights of victims, and prevent the abuse of freedoms by foreign criminals and terrorists.

Against - The opponents of the Bill criticise it for being too harsh, too vague, or too intrusive. They raise concerns about the impact of the Bill on civil liberties, human rights, judicial discretion, and prison overcrowding. They also question the effectiveness of some of the measures in reducing crime and reoffending.

Decision - The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill will tighten immigration and borders, because it will create a new special immigration status for foreign nationals who cannot be deported but pose a risk to national security or public order[1]. This status will limit their access to benefits, services, and employment, and subject them to monitoring and reporting requirements.

Sentiment - A
