Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, which aims to reduce the public sector net borrowing and the deficit. The Bill is opposed by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who argue that it is flawed, irrelevant and ineffective.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Bill and the Government's plan to halve the deficit by 2014. It means trusting the Government's judgment and forecasts, and believing that legislating for fiscal responsibility is a credible and necessary step.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means rejecting the Bill and the Government's plan as inadequate, unrealistic and harmful. It means advocating for a faster and deeper reduction of the deficit, and questioning the Government's competence and honesty. It also means rejecting the idea that legislating for fiscal responsibility is useful or meaningful.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with austerity and regulation, because it implies accepting the Government's spending cuts and tax increases, as well as its attempt to constrain future fiscal policy by law.

Sentiment - B
