Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Coroners and Justice Bill, which includes a clause on incitement to hatred on grounds of sexual orientation. The debate focuses on whether to keep or remove a free speech clause that was added by Lord Waddington.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the amendment to remove the free speech clause, which some argue is unnecessary, dangerous or misleading. They claim that the clause could allow extremists to avoid prosecution or undermine the protection of gay people from homophobic hatred.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the amendment and keeping the free speech clause, which some argue is essential, reasonable or reassuring. They claim that the clause could prevent vexatious complaints or intrusive investigations against people who express legitimate views on sexual conduct or practices.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with freedom and autonomy, limiting police powers and softer punishments, limiting Crime and Justice. This is because voting 'Aye' would uphold the original wording of the offence, which requires threatening words or behaviour with intent to stir up hatred, and respect the rights to freedom of expression, thought, conscience and religion.

Sentiment - B
