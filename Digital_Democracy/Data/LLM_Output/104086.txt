Summary - The text file is a transcript of a UK parliamentary debate on the humanitarian crisis in Burma after Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The debate focuses on how to persuade the Burmese regime to allow international aid and assistance.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the original motion, which calls for invoking the 'responsibility to protect' principle and urges the UN Security Council to take action against the Burmese regime for failing to protect its people.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means supporting the amendment, which focuses on diplomatic efforts to secure access and ensure aid delivery, and avoids mentioning the 'responsibility to protect' principle or any coercive measures against the Burmese regime.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other foreign affairs, because it implies a willingness to intervene in another country's affairs for humanitarian reasons, and to work with multilateral institutions such as the UN and the EU to do so.

Sentiment - A
