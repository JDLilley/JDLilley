Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament about crime in London. The Conservative party criticises the Labour Mayor and the Government for being complacent and ineffective in tackling violent crime, antisocial behaviour, and fare evasion. The Labour party defends its record and challenges the Conservative proposals.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Conservative motion that condemns the current Mayor of London for his complacent attitude to serious crime issues and calls for tougher, more effective law and order policies, such as cutting bureaucracy, increasing police presence, and imposing new sanctions for offenders.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means rejecting the Conservative motion and backing the Government amendment that praises the achievements of the Mayor of London and the police in reducing crime and improving public safety, and recognises the challenges of policing a diverse and complex city.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, strengthening Crime & Justice. Voting 'Aye' implies that crime in London is unacceptable and requires more intervention and enforcement from the authorities[1]. It also implies that the current Mayor of London and the Government are not doing enough to protect Londoners from crime.

Sentiment - A
