Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the European Commission's proposal for a Connecting Europe Facility, which aims to fund infrastructure projects in transport, energy and telecommunications across the EU[1]. The debate covers the budget, the benefits and the drawbacks of the proposal.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the amendment proposed by the Labour party, which calls for a more growth-oriented approach to the EU budget and the Connecting Europe Facility. It also calls for a reduction in the Common Agricultural Policy spending and a review of the impact of the structural funds.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means rejecting the amendment and supporting the original motion proposed by the Government, which opposes the Commission's proposal for substantial increases in EU spending on the Connecting Europe Facility. It also supports the Government's efforts to reduce both the budget for the facility and the overall level of spending in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.

Decision - Voting 'Ayes' in the division is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other Foreign Affairs, as it implies a willingness to cooperate with other EU member states on common challenges and opportunities, such as improving connectivity, competitiveness and sustainability. It also reflects a recognition of the need for a balanced and comprehensive strategy that combines fiscal discipline with investment in growth.
