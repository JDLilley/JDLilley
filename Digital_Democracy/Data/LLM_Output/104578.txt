Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Energy Bill in 2023, which aims to promote low-carbon electricity generation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The debate covers various aspects of the Bill, such as the carbon emissions performance standard (EPS), the electricity supply levy, and the decarbonisation of coal-fired power stations.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government's amendment to add a new clause that requires regular reports on the progress of decarbonisation and CCS. This would ensure accountability and transparency of the Government's policies and actions, and allow for possible revisions if needed. It would also show commitment to tackling climate change and leading the world on clean coal technology[1].

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Government's amendment and favouring one of the alternative new clauses proposed by the Opposition or some Labour Back Benchers. These new clauses would introduce an EPS immediately or by 2025, which would set a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted by any electricity generating station[2]. This would prevent or delay any new investment in coal or gas power stations, and jeopardise the demonstration and development of CCS.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with prioritising environmental sustainability in the context of Environment & Energy, because it supports the Government's ambitious plan to decarbonise the electricity sector and develop CCS as a key technology to reduce emissions from fossil fuels. It also recognises the need for regular assessment and review of the policies and their outcomes, and the possibility of introducing further measures if necessary.

Sentiment - A
