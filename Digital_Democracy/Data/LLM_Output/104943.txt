Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Finance (No. 3) Bill, which covers various tax and financial issues. The main topic of discussion is the bank levy and the bank bonus tax, proposed by different amendments.

For - Voting for amendment 12 means supporting a bank bonus tax that would raise revenue to create jobs and tackle unemployment, especially among young people. It also means challenging the excessive and offensive bonuses paid to senior bankers, and making them pay their fair share.

Against - Voting against amendment 12 means rejecting a bank bonus tax that would harm the competitiveness and stability of the UK financial sector, and preferring a bank levy that raises more money from the banks than the previous government's bonus tax. It also means respecting the international agreements on bank regulation and taxation.

Decision - Voting for amendment 12 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it aims to use the revenue from the bank bonus tax to boost the economy and create jobs, rather than reducing the deficit or increasing public spending. It also challenges the existing power structure of the banking industry and promotes greater transparency and accountability.

Sentiment - A
