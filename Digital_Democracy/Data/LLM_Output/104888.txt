Summary - The current web page context is a transcript of the UK Parliament's House of Commons debate on the Finance (No. 3) Bill. The bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 22 March 2011 and received Royal Assent on 19 July 2011. The bill contained provisions for the UK government's revenue-raising measures for the financial year 2011-12. 

For - Amendment 9 proposed that the Chancellor should review the bank levy and publish a report before December 31, 2011, on the government's analysis behind the rate and threshold chosen for the bank levy, the adequacy of the bank levy in the context of other reforms to the wider banking system, and the total tax revenues expected from banks across all categories of taxation in each year from 2011-12 to 2016-17.

Against - The opposition party was unable to table amendments to Finance Bills that would have the effect of raising the level of taxation[1]. Instead, they called for a review of the rate and general approach to bank taxation adopted by the Treasury[2].
