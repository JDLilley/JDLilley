The debate covers various amendments and clauses of the bill, as well as the views and concerns of different MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Digital Economy Bill [Lords], Question put, That the amendment 2 be made, means supporting the amendment proposed by Mr. Don Foster, which would require a market impact assessment before imposing any technical measures on internet service providers or subscribers. This would ensure that the bill does not harm the competitiveness and diversity of the digital sector.
