Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on a bill that aims to make corporations liable for manslaughter and homicide. The bill was passed with a programme motion and a carry-over motion. A point of order was raised to honour Eric Forth.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the bill, which would hold corporations accountable for deaths caused by their gross negligence or breach of duty. This would deter corporate crimes and protect public safety.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the bill, which would impose excessive burdens and penalties on businesses and organisations. This would stifle innovation and productivity and harm the economy.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. It would give the authorities more power to investigate and prosecute corporate offenders and impose higher fines and sanctions on them.

Sentiment - A
