Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on 11 June 2007 about whether to hold an inquiry into the Iraq war. The main arguments for and against the motion are presented by the Conservative and Labour parties respectively.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Iraq Inquiry means supporting the principle of an independent committee of Privy Councillors to examine the decision-making process and the aftermath of the military action in Iraq. It also means calling for an early start of such an inquiry, before the end of 2007.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Iraq Inquiry means rejecting the proposal for a new inquiry, as there have already been four separate independent committees of inquiry into different aspects of the Iraq war. It also means arguing that launching an inquiry now would divert attention from the vital task of improving the condition of Iraq and supporting the British troops there.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Iraq Inquiry is associated with increased accountability and limiting powers of Defence & Armed Forces, as it implies a desire to scrutinize the Government's actions and learn from the mistakes made in Iraq. It also suggests a lack of confidence in the Government's handling of the war and its aftermath.

Sentiment - B
