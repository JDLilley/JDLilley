Hello, this is Bing. Here is my response to your request:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill in 2008. The bill aimed to reform various aspects of the criminal justice system and immigration law.

For - The supporters of the amendment argued that it was necessary to reintroduce a statutory ban on industrial action by prison officers, as the voluntary agreement had failed to prevent strikes that endangered public safety and prisoner welfare.

Against - The opponents of the amendment claimed that it was a breach of trust and a violation of the rights of prison officers, who had been promised by the Labour party that the ban would be lifted. They also said that it would sour the relations between the government and the union.

Decision - The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, That the amendment be made would tighten immigration and borders, as it would give more powers to the Home Secretary to deport foreign criminals and to detain asylum seekers.

Sentiment - A
