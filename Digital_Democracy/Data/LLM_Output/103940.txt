Summary - The text file is a part of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which covers various aspects of criminal justice, sentencing, prison management, and immigration. The bill was debated in the House of Lords in 2008 and received Royal Assent later that year.

For - Voting for the amendment in the division would mean reinstating section 127 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which prohibits industrial action by prison officers. The supporters of the amendment argue that this is necessary to protect public safety and prisoner welfare, and to prevent disorder and violence in prisons.

Against - Voting against the amendment in the division would mean rejecting the reintroduction of section 127, which was repealed in 2005 and replaced by a voluntary agreement with the Prison Officers Association. The opponents of the amendment argue that this is a breach of trust and a violation of the working rights of prison officers, who deserve fair pay and conditions.

Decision - The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, That the amendment be made, would tighten immigration and borders, because it would make it easier to deport foreign criminals under the UK Borders Act 2007. The amendment would also give the Secretary of State more power to remove prisoners from the UK under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 or 2003.

Sentiment - A
