Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Pensions Bill, which aims to introduce a new scheme of personal accounts for workers to save for retirement. The debate covers various aspects of the Bill, such as the start date, the costs, the charges, and the impact on existing pension providers.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Bill and its intention to increase pension saving among low and moderate earners. It means agreeing with the Government that the scheme will be ready by 2012, that the costs will be recouped from members, and that the scheme will not undermine existing pension provision.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Bill and its potential risks and flaws. It means questioning the Government's ability to deliver the scheme on time and within budget, and expressing concerns about the level of charges, the quality of service, and the effect on other pension providers.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with greater spending on, and provision of, welfare and social housing. This is because the Bill aims to improve the retirement income of millions of workers who would otherwise rely on state benefits or social housing in old age. By encouraging them to save for their own pensions, the Bill reduces the future burden on public spending and increases their financial security.

Sentiment - A
