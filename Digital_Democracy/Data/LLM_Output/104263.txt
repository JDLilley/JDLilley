Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Coroners and Justice Bill, which aims to reform the law on homicide, assisted suicide, coroners, and other criminal justice matters. The debate covers various aspects of the Bill and the views of different parties and MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government's motion to waive the requirement for deferred divisions on the Criminal Law motion, which relates to Part 2 of the Bill. This would allow the House to vote on the motion immediately after the debate, rather than on a later date.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Government's motion to waive the requirement for deferred divisions on the Criminal Law motion, which relates to Part 2 of the Bill. This would require the House to vote on the motion on a later date, following a ballot of all MPs.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because Part 2 of the Bill contains provisions that would increase the penalties for assisted suicide, abolish the defence of provocation, and remove the freedom of speech amendment on inciting hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation[1].

Sentiment - A
