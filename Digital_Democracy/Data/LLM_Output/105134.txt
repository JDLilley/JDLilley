For - Voting for the Second Reading Motion means supporting the government's plan to reduce the deficit, promote private sector growth, and create a fairer tax system.

Against - Voting against the Second Reading Motion means opposing the government's plan and favouring alternative proposals. The opposition argues that the government's measures are unfair, ineffective, and damaging to the economy and public services. The opposition criticises the government for cutting the top rate of income tax, capping tax reliefs for charities, and reducing tax credits and child benefit for low and middle-income families.

The government's plan involves reducing public spending, increasing taxes on banks and high-value properties, and introducing new rules to prevent tax avoidance and evasion.
