Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill, which aims to replace the control orders regime for suspected terrorists. The debate covers various amendments and issues related to the Bill.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting Amendment 20, which would allow the Secretary of State to impose a TPIM notice on a person who has been convicted of a terrorism-related offence, even if they are not currently engaged in terrorism-related activity. This would strengthen the Government's ability to monitor and restrict such individuals.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing Amendment 20, which would extend the scope of TPIM notices beyond the current threshold of necessity and proportionality. This would undermine the civil liberties and human rights of people who have served their sentences and are no longer involved in terrorism.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with softer regulations and growing powers of Defence & Armed Forces, as it would give the Government more discretion and authority to impose TPIM notices on former terrorists without sufficient evidence of current threat.

Sentiment - A
