New Clause 5 introduces a targeted anti-avoidance rule that tackles the use of tax avoidance schemes designed to generate deductions in respect of “expenses of management” under section 75 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988[1]. If left unchecked, those schemes would cost the UK Exchequer—the public purse—£1 billion a year[2][3].
