Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill, which introduces changes to inheritance tax and trusts. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the Opposition and the Government, and the arguments for and against them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on the Finance (No. 2) Bill means supporting the Government's proposals to prevent tax avoidance through trusts, and to exclude trusts for disabled people from the new tax charges[1]. The Government claims that the Bill is fair, simple and consistent with its policy on disability.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on the Finance (No. 2) Bill means opposing the Government's proposals and supporting the Opposition's amendments, which aim to broaden the definition of disability, protect trusts for young people, life insurance and relationship breakdown, and correct technical anomalies. The Opposition argues that the Bill is unfair, complex and discriminatory.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on the Finance (No. 2) Bill is associated with austerity and regulation, because it imposes new tax charges on most types of trusts, except for those for disabled people, which are narrowly defined. It also restricts the flexibility and choice of people who want to use trusts for legitimate purposes.

Sentiment - B
