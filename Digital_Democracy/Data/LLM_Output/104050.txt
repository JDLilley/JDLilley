Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament about crime in London. The Conservative party criticises the Labour Mayor and the Government for being complacent and ineffective in tackling violent crime, antisocial behaviour, and fare evasion. The Labour party defends its record and challenges the Conservative proposals.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Conservative motion that condemns the current Mayor of London for his complacent attitude to serious crime issues and calls for more police powers, tougher sanctions, and less bureaucracy.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means rejecting the Conservative motion and backing the Government amendment that praises the achievements of the Mayor of London and the Metropolitan Police in reducing crime and improving public safety.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, strengthening Crime & Justice. The Conservative motion advocates for more visible policing, more weapons scanners, reform of stop-and-search powers, withdrawal of bus passes for antisocial behaviour, and cutting red tape for officers.

Sentiment - A
