Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, which aims to reduce the public sector net borrowing and the deficit. The Bill is opposed by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who argue that it is flawed, irrelevant and ineffective.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Bill and the Government's plan to cut the deficit gradually over five years. It also means accepting the statutory duty to lower the borrowing every year and to halve it by 2014. It implies trusting the Government's projections and forecasts for the economy.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means rejecting the Bill and the Government's plan as insufficient, unrealistic and damaging. It also means favouring a faster and deeper reduction of the deficit and the structural element of it. It implies questioning the Government's credibility and competence on fiscal matters.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with austerity and regulation, because it involves legislating to constrain the Government's fiscal policy and to impose a rigid timetable for deficit reduction. It also implies accepting higher taxes and lower spending to achieve fiscal consolidation.

Sentiment - B
