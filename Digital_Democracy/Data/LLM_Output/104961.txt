Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill, which aims to replace the control orders regime with a new system of restrictions and surveillance for suspected terrorists. The debate covers various aspects of the Bill, such as its duration, commencement, safeguards, and emergency provisions.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Bill and its proposed changes to the counter-terrorism legislation. It means agreeing that the Bill strikes a balance between national security and civil liberties, and that the police and security services have adequate resources and capabilities to implement the new system.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Bill and its proposed changes to the counter-terrorism legislation. It means arguing that the Bill weakens the existing powers to protect the public from terrorist threats, and that the police and security services are not ready or able to cope with the increased risks under the new system.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with softer regulations and growing powers of Defence & Armed Forces. This is because the Bill reduces some of the restrictions and conditions that can be imposed on suspected terrorists, such as relocation and longer curfews. It also gives more discretion and flexibility to the Secretary of State and the courts to impose, vary, or revoke TPIM notices. It also allows for emergency measures to be introduced by order without prior parliamentary approval in urgent situations.

Sentiment - A
