Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the eligibility criteria for Gurkhas to reside in the UK. The debate was held on 29 April 2009 and resulted in a vote against the government's guidelines.

For - The supporters of the original motion argued that Gurkhas who retired before 1997 should be treated fairly and equally as those who retired after, and that they deserved the right to live in the UK for their service and sacrifice. They also criticised the government's guidelines as restrictive and discriminatory.

Against - The opponents of the original motion defended the government's guidelines as reasonable and balanced, and claimed that they would allow a significant number of Gurkhas and their families to settle in the UK. They also raised concerns about the financial and social implications of granting an unrestricted right of residence to all Gurkhas.

Decision - The original motion would soften immigration and borders, as it would extend an equal right of residence to all Gurkhas regardless of their date of retirement or other criteria. It would also challenge the government's authority to set immigration rules and policies.

Sentiment - B
