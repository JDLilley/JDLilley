Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on a programme motion for the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, which deals with various aspects of the UK constitution, such as the civil service, the House of Lords, and the ratification of treaties.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government's timetable for the Bill, which allocates four days for the Committee stage and specifies when each part of the Bill should be concluded. The Government argues that this is necessary to ensure proper scrutiny and progress of the Bill, which has been preceded by extensive consultation and reports.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Government's timetable for the Bill, which imposes internal guillotines and knives that limit the time and scope of debate on each part of the Bill. The Opposition argues that this is unacceptable for a constitutional Bill, which should allow every Member to participate and have their say on important matters, such as reforming the House of Lords and the role of the Attorney-General.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with reduced bureaucracy and centralisation in the context of Parliamentary Procedures, because it gives more power to the Government to control the business of the House and to restrict the opportunities for amendments and discussions by other Members. It also reduces the complexity and duration of the legislative process.

Sentiment - B
