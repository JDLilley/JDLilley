Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Finance Bill, which sets the main rates and rules for corporation tax. The debate covers various amendments proposed by different parties and their arguments for and against them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on clause 11 means supporting the amendment to reduce the small profits rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20%. The argument for this amendment is that it would help small businesses to survive and grow in the recession, and create more jobs and investment.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on clause 11 means opposing the amendment to reduce the small profits rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20%. The argument against this amendment is that it would cost the Exchequer Â£1.5 billion in lost revenue, and that it would not be fair or effective to give a tax cut to all small businesses regardless of their profitability or need.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on clause 11 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies a preference for lower taxes, less government intervention, and more incentives for private sector activity.

Sentiment - A
