Thank you for your request. I have reviewed the text file open in your current webpage and here is my response:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Crime and Courts Bill [Lords], which deals with the National Crime Agency (NCA) and its role in counter-terrorism and Northern Ireland. The debate covers the arguments for and against giving the NCA counter-terrorism functions and limiting its operations in Northern Ireland.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting amendment 95, which would remove clause 12 from the Bill. Clause 12 would allow the Home Secretary to confer counter-terrorism functions on the NCA by order, subject to parliamentary approval. Those who support amendment 95 argue that such a significant change should be made by primary legislation, not by order, and that it would affect national security and devolution arrangements.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing amendment 95 and keeping clause 12 in the Bill. Those who oppose amendment 95 argue that clause 12 provides flexibility for the Government to implement the outcome of a future review of counter-terrorism policing arrangements, after the NCA is established and operational. They also argue that clause 12 provides a high level of parliamentary scrutiny through the super-affirmative procedure.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with freedom & autonomy, limiting police powers & softer punishments, limiting Crime & Justice. This is because voting 'Aye' would prevent the Home Secretary from giving the NCA counter-terrorism functions by order, which could potentially increase the NCA's powers and scope, reduce the accountability of local police forces, and affect the devolution settlement in Northern Ireland.

Sentiment - B
