Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the summary of the debate in 50 words: 

Summary - The Chancellor was praised for the longest unbroken expansion on record, with GDP growing in 58 consecutive quarters, for stability in GDP growth, and for low inflation rates[1]. The Budget raised the higher personal allowance for pensioners and increased child tax credit, working tax credit threshold, and reduced corporation tax as well as the basic rate of tax[2]. Vehicle excise duty has been increased[3]. Investment in education by 2.5% in real terms is an important measure[4].

For - The 'Ayes' (For) voted in favor of the Budget Resolutions and Economic Situation division which included raising the higher personal allowance for pensioners, increasing child tax credit, working tax credit threshold, reducing corporation tax as well as the basic rate of tax and increasing vehicle excise duty[2]. 

Against - The 'Noes' (Against) voted against the Budget Resolutions and Economic Situation division which included raising the higher personal allowance for pensioners, increasing child tax credit, working tax credit threshold, reducing corporation tax as well as the basic rate of tax and increasing vehicle excise duty.

Therefore, my decision is that voting 'Aye' in the division: Budget Resolutions and Economic Situation is associated with stimulus & the free market .


Sentiment - A
