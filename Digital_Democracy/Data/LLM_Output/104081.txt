Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Education and Skills Bill, which aims to amend the law on school admissions, attendance, and other matters. The debate covers various aspects of the bill, such as admission arrangements, co-ordination of admission schemes, and reports by local education authorities.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the new clause 14, which would give priority to children who are looked after by a local authority in England in school admissions. This would help to improve the educational outcomes and life chances of these vulnerable children, who often face disadvantages and instability in their schooling.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the new clause 14, which would impose a blanket requirement on all admission authorities to give preference to children who are looked after by a local authority in England. This would undermine the autonomy and diversity of schools, and could create difficulties for schools with a religious character or a selective intake.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with increased education and learning, as it would ensure that children who are looked after by a local authority in England have access to suitable and high-quality education that meets their needs and aspirations. It would also promote social justice and inclusion, as it would reduce the gap between these children and their peers.

Sentiment - A
