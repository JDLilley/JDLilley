Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Treaty of Lisbon, which amends the EU treaties and affects foreign and defence policy.

For - The supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon argue that it will enhance the EU's role in the world, promote co-operation with NATO, and respect the sovereignty and diversity of member states[1]. They also claim that the treaty is different from the rejected constitution and does not require a referendum.

Against - The opponents of the Treaty of Lisbon contend that it will undermine NATO, create a European army and a foreign minister, and erode the UK's national interest and democracy. They also insist that the treaty is essentially the same as the constitution and should be put to a public vote.

Decision - The Treaty of Lisbon (No. 5), Main Question put forthwith would soften immigration and borders, as it would increase the EU's competences in areas such as asylum, migration, border control, and visa policy. It would also introduce more qualified majority voting and reduce national vetoes in these matters.

Sentiment - B
