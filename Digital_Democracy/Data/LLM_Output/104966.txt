Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill that would require abortion providers to offer independent counselling to women seeking termination of pregnancy.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the amendment, which aims to separate the financial incentive from the counselling service and to provide more choice and support for vulnerable women who may be unsure or distressed about their decision.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the amendment, which is seen as unnecessary, inappropriate and potentially harmful to women's access to abortion services. The opponents argue that the current system works well and that abortion providers are capable of providing impartial and professional counselling.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with investment in public health and improving standards of care, in the context of Health & Healthcare. The proponents of the amendment claim that it would enhance the quality and availability of counselling for women who may benefit from it, and that it would address the mental health risks associated with abortion.

Sentiment - A
