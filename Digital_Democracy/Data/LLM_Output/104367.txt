Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Finance Bill, which deals with various tax-related issues. The debate covers topics such as corporation tax, tax avoidance, tax accounting, and tax relief.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the amendment to clause 14, which would reduce the rate of corporation tax for small and medium-sized enterprises from 21% to 20%. The amendment is proposed by the Conservative party, which argues that it would boost the economy and create jobs.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the amendment to clause 14, and keeping the rate of corporation tax for small and medium-sized enterprises at 21%. The amendment is opposed by the Labour party, which argues that it would benefit only a few companies and reduce the public revenue.
