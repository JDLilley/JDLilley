Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the timetable and procedure for scrutinising the European Union (Amendment) Bill, which implements the Lisbon Treaty in the UK.

For - The Government argues that the motion will ensure a structured, themed and comprehensive debate on the Bill, covering a range of issues arising from the Lisbon Treaty, and avoid unnecessary delays or disruptions[1].

Against - The Opposition and some backbenchers argue that the motion is unnecessary, restrictive and undemocratic, as it limits the time and scope of debate on a constitutional matter of great importance and interest to the public.

Decision - The motion does not directly affect immigration and borders, but it could have an indirect impact by facilitating or hindering the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which contains provisions on asylum, migration and border control. Voting for the motion could be seen as softening immigration and borders by supporting a more integrated and harmonised EU policy, while voting against it could be seen as tightening immigration and borders by opposing further EU integration and preserving national sovereignty.

Sentiment - B
