Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill that would require abortion providers to offer independent counselling to women seeking termination of pregnancy. The amendment was proposed by Nadine Dorries, a Conservative MP, and sparked a heated discussion among MPs from different parties and views.

For - Voting 'Ayes' for the amendment means supporting the idea that women should have access to impartial and non-directive counselling before making a decision about abortion. It also means challenging the potential conflict of interest that abortion providers may have in offering counselling, as they may benefit financially from performing abortions.

Against - Voting 'Noes' for the amendment means opposing the idea that abortion providers are incapable of providing unbiased and professional counselling to women. It also means defending the existing system of abortion counselling, which is regulated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and other medical bodies, and respecting the choice and autonomy of women.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' for the amendment is more associated with investment in public health and improving standards of care, in the context of Health & Healthcare, than with fiscal responsibility. This is because the amendment aims to enhance the quality and availability of counselling services for women who may need emotional and psychological support before and after an abortion. It also seeks to ensure that women are not influenced by any financial motives of abortion providers, but rather by their own informed consent.

Sentiment - A
