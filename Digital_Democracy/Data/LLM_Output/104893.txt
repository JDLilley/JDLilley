Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill to require schools to teach abstinence to girls aged 13-16 as part of sex education. The bill was proposed by Nadine Dorries and opposed by Chris Bryant.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the bill and agreeing that abstinence is a viable option for girls to avoid teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and social pressure. It also means believing that sex education is too focused on the mechanics of sex and not enough on relationships and self-respect.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means rejecting the bill and arguing that abstinence is not an effective strategy to reduce teenage pregnancy, and that it is unfair to target only girls and not boys. It also means advocating for comprehensive sex and relationship education that starts at an early age and covers all aspects of sexuality.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with limiting education and learning, because it restricts the information and choices that girls have about their sexual health and well-being. It also ignores the evidence that shows that abstinence-only programs do not work and may have negative consequences for young people.

Sentiment - B
