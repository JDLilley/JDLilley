Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill that would end eligibility for child trust funds and health in pregnancy grants. The bill was opposed by Labour and supported by the coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the bill and agreeing with the government's argument that it is necessary to reduce public spending and borrowing, and that child trust funds are ineffective and wasteful. It also means accepting the proposal of a junior ISA as an alternative savings vehicle.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the bill and agreeing with Labour's argument that it is unfair and harmful to scrap child trust funds, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable children. It also means rejecting the idea of a junior ISA as an inadequate and inaccessible replacement.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with austerity & regulation, because it implies favouring fiscal consolidation and cutting public benefits, as well as imposing more rules on how parents can save for their children.

Sentiment - B
