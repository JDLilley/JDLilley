Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Climate Change Bill, which aims to set legally binding targets and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and adapt to climate change impacts.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Climate Change Bill (lords) (programme) means supporting the Government's proposal to allocate time for the Bill's further consideration and passage in the House of Commons. It also means agreeing with the Government's amendments to the Bill, such as removing the purpose clause and the limit on international credits.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Climate Change Bill (lords) (programme) means opposing the Government's proposal to allocate time for the Bill's further consideration and passage in the House of Commons.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Climate Change Bill (lords) (programme) is associated with prioritising environmental sustainability in the context of Environment & Energy. This is because the Bill aims to establish a clear framework for the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy and to ensure that the UK adapts to unavoidable climate change[1]. The Government's amendments are intended to strengthen the Bill and make it more flexible and credible.
