Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Business Rate Supplements Bill, which allows local authorities to levy an additional tax on businesses to fund infrastructure projects. The debate covers the merits and drawbacks of the bill and its amendments.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the government's position that a ballot of businesses should not be mandatory for every business rate supplement, but only for those that fund more than one third of a project's cost[1]. This would give local authorities more flexibility and avoid unnecessary costs and delays.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means supporting the Lords' amendment that a ballot of businesses should be mandatory for every business rate supplement, regardless of the proportion of funding. This would give businesses more certainty and control over their tax liabilities and ensure their consent for any additional levy.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it allows local authorities to raise funds for infrastructure projects that could boost economic growth and development, without having to seek approval from central government or business groups.

Sentiment - A
