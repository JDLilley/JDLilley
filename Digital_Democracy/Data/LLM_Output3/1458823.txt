Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - The Government argues that voting for the motion to disagree with LA 26B will ensure that support for victims of modern slavery is based on individual needs and circumstances, rather than a fixed period of time. The Government also says that it has committed to provide tailored support for at least 12 months where necessary[1].

Against - The Opposition argues that voting against the motion to disagree with LA 26B will protect the rights and dignity of victims of modern slavery by guaranteeing them a minimum of 12 months of support, regardless of their immigration status or outcome of their claim. The Opposition also says that this will help victims to recover from trauma and access justice.

Decision - The motion to disagree with LA 26B would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reduce the scope and duration of support for victims of modern slavery who are seeking asylum or have irregular immigration status. It would also create uncertainty and inconsistency in the provision of support, which could deter victims from coming forward or cooperating with authorities.

Sentiment - A
