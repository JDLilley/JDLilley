Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter and remove illegal migrants who arrive by small boats. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 103B, which relates to the National Crime Agency's functions[1][2]. The Government argues that the amendment is unnecessary, as the NCA already has the power and duty to tackle organised immigration crime.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 103B, and supporting the amendment instead[2][3]. The amendment seeks to clarify and strengthen the NCA's role in preventing and investigating human trafficking and smuggling, and to ensure its co-operation with other agencies.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with tighter immigration and borders, as it rejects an amendment that could enhance the NCA's ability to protect vulnerable migrants and prosecute criminal networks. Voting 'Aye' also aligns with the Government's overall approach of creating a deterrent for illegal migration.

Sentiment - A
