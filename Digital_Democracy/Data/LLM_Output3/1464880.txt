Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Public Order Bill, which aims to give more powers to the police to deal with disruptive protests. The Bill is supported by the Government and opposed by the Opposition and some backbenchers.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government's view that the Bill is necessary to protect the public from serious disruption caused by harmful protests, such as those by Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. It also means backing the police to use more proactive and preventive measures to deal with protesters who lock on, obstruct transport works or interfere with key national infrastructure.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Government's view that the Bill is proportionate and respects the right to protest peacefully. It also means challenging the Government's failure to address other urgent issues such as the cost of living, crime and justice, and victims' rights. It also means defending the historic freedoms of peaceful protest from being eroded by measures that are too widely drawn and give too much discretion to the police and the courts.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because the Bill would give more authority to the police to stop, search, arrest and impose conditions on protesters who cause or could cause serious disruption. It would also create new criminal offences and court orders that could result in fines or imprisonment for protesters who lock on, obstruct transport works or interfere with key national infrastructure[1].

Sentiment - A
