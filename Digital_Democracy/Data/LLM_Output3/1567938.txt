Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill, which aims to end the supremacy of EU law and revoke or reform some of the retained EU legislation after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and issues related to the Bill.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on Amendment 36 means supporting the amendment, which would require the Government to consult with devolved authorities before revoking or reforming any retained EU law that affects devolved matters. This would respect the devolution settlements and ensure a coherent approach across the UK.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on Amendment 36 means opposing the amendment, which would impose an unnecessary and burdensome requirement on the Government to consult with devolved authorities on every retained EU law that affects devolved matters. This would delay the process of revoking or reforming unnecessary or outdated EU laws and undermine the sovereignty of the UK Parliament.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on Amendment 36 is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other foreign affairs, because it implies a preference for maintaining alignment and cooperation with the EU and respecting the views of different parts of the UK that may have different interests or perspectives on EU matters.

Sentiment - A
