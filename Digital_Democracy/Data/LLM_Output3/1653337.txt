Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter and remove illegal migrants who arrive by small boats. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 56B, which would require the Home Secretary to consult with relevant stakeholders before making regulations on the removal of migrants to safe third countries. The Government argues that this amendment would delay and undermine the removal process and create legal challenges.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 56B, which would require the Home Secretary to consult with relevant stakeholders before making regulations on the removal of migrants to safe third countries. The Opposition argues that this amendment would ensure proper scrutiny and accountability of the Government's policy and protect the rights and welfare of migrants.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 56B is associated with tighter immigration and borders, as it would enable the Government to remove migrants more quickly and easily without consulting with other parties[1].

Sentiment - A
