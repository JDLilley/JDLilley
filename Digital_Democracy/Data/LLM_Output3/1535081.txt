Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament about reducing the stamp duty land tax for residential property buyers. The debate includes an amendment to exclude additional properties from the tax cut, which is rejected by the majority.

For - Voting 'Ayes' for the amendment means supporting the proposal to keep the higher rates of stamp duty for second homes, landlords and holiday home buyers. This would prevent subsidising these purchases with public money and protect local communities from excessive second home ownership.

Against - Voting 'Noes' for the amendment means opposing the proposal to exclude additional properties from the tax cut. This would maintain the uniformity of the stamp duty system and avoid creating a separate schedule of rates for different types of buyers. It would also support the housing market as a whole.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' for the amendment is associated with greater spending on, and provision of, welfare and social housing. This is because it would generate more revenue for the public sector and reduce the demand for housing from wealthy investors. It would also help to preserve the affordability and availability of housing for low-income and first-time buyers.

Sentiment - A
