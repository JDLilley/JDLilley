Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments and the Government's objections to them.

For - The Government argues that the Bill is necessary to stop the boats, prevent abuse of the asylum system, and uphold the rule of law[1]. They say that Lords amendment 104, which requires a 10-year strategy on human trafficking and refugee crises, is too prescriptive and unrealistic.

Against - The Opposition argues that the Bill is cruel, counterproductive, and unlawful. They say that Lords amendment 104 is vital to address the root causes of migration and to show international leadership and co-operation. They accuse the Government of breaking their manifesto promises and creating a humanitarian crisis.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 104 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reject a long-term plan to tackle the global challenges of human trafficking and refugee protection. It would also signal a lack of commitment to work with other countries on these issues.

Sentiment - A
