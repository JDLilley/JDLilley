Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament about the Online Safety Bill, which aims to regulate online platforms and protect users from harmful content. The debate focuses on the proposed changes to the Bill and the need for further scrutiny.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the Government's motion to recommit some clauses of the Bill to a Public Bill Committee for a short period of time. This would allow the House to examine the amendments that strengthen child protection and free speech[1].

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the Government's motion and preferring to send the Bill to the House of Lords as soon as possible. This would avoid further delays and risks to the Bill, which has already been scrutinised extensively in Committee and on Report.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is not directly associated with either A or B, as it is not about the substance of the Bill but about the process of its passage. However, one could argue that voting 'Aye' implies a preference for more transparency and accountability in law-making, which could be seen as a form of limiting Crime & Justice.

Sentiment - B
