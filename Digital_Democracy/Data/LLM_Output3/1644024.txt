Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Procurement Bill, which aims to reform the public procurement system after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for Amendment 3 means supporting a discretionary exclusion ground for suppliers who have participated in forced organ harvesting or unethical activities relating to human tissue[1]. This would prevent public contracts from being awarded to those who are involved in such grave human rights violations.

Against - Voting against Amendment 3 means opposing the discretionary exclusion ground for suppliers who have participated in forced organ harvesting or unethical activities relating to human tissue[1]. This could be because of concerns about the evidence, the scope, the enforcement or the impact of such a measure on trade relations.

Decision - Voting for Amendment 3 is associated with regulation, as it imposes a restriction on the eligibility of suppliers based on their conduct and compliance with human rights standards. It is not directly related to stimulus or the free market, as it does not affect the level of public spending or the competitiveness of the procurement process.

Sentiment - B
