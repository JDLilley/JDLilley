Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to stop illegal boat crossings and remove asylum seekers to Rwanda. The Bill is supported by the Government and opposed by the Opposition.

For - The Government argues that the Bill is necessary to secure the UK's borders, reform the broken asylum system, end dangerous boat crossings, deter people smugglers, protect genuine refugees and respect the public's wishes.

Against - The Opposition argues that the Bill fails to meet its objectives, lacks effective measures to tackle criminal gangs, increases the backlog of asylum cases, leaves victims of modern slavery without protection, undermines international co-operation and breaches human rights obligations.

Decision - The Reasoned Amendment to Second Reading would reject the Bill and propose an alternative approach. Voting for the amendment would soften immigration and borders by preventing the removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda and maintaining access to the UK's asylum system.

Sentiment - B
