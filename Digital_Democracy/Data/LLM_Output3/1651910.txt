Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments and the Government's objections to them.

For - The Government argues that the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 73, which would exempt victims of modern slavery from being removed, is necessary to prevent false claims and abuse of the system. The Government says it will offer mitigations and guidance to protect genuine victims.

Against - The Opposition and some Conservative MPs argue that the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 73, which would exempt victims of modern slavery from being removed, is cruel and counterproductive. They say it will discourage victims from coming forward, drive them back into exploitation, and hinder the prosecution of traffickers.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 73 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reduce the protection and support for asylum seekers who are victims of modern slavery, and make it easier for the Government to remove them to third countries or detain them indefinitely.

Sentiment - A
