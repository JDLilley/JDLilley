Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to reform the UK's asylum system and deter irregular arrivals. The debate covers various amendments and clauses related to removal, detention, support and citizenship of migrants.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Amendment 189 means supporting an exception to the duty to remove a person who is an Afghan national and faces a real risk of persecution or harm in Afghanistan[1]. This is based on the humanitarian crisis and security situation in that country.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Amendment 189 means opposing an exception to the duty to remove a person who is an Afghan national and faces a real risk of persecution or harm in Afghanistan[1]. This is based on the principle of maintaining a fair and firm asylum system and preventing abuse.

Decision - The Amendment 189 would soften immigration and borders, as it would allow some Afghan nationals who arrived irregularly in the UK to remain and claim asylum, instead of being removed to a safe third country or their country of origin[2].

Sentiment - B
