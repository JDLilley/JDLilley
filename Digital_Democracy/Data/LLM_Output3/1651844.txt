Thank you for your request. Here is my response:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate focuses on the Lords amendments that challenge the Government's proposals.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 8 means supporting the Government's view that unaccompanied children who arrive by irregular routes should not have their asylum claims automatically treated as admissible. The Government argues that this will prevent abuse of the system and discourage dangerous journeys.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 8 means supporting the Lords' view that unaccompanied children who are exempt from removal should have their asylum claims treated as admissible regardless of their route of arrival. The Lords argue that this will protect the best interests of the child and uphold the UK's obligations under international law.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 8 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would create a two-tier system of asylum based on how people arrive in the UK and reduce the chances of unaccompanied children being granted protection.

Sentiment - A
