Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments and the Government's objections to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 90, which would require the Government to publish a 10-year strategy on countering human trafficking and responding to international refugee crises.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means opposing the Government's motion and supporting Lords Amendment 90, which would oblige the Government to have a long-term plan on how to address the root causes of migration and protect the rights of refugees and victims of trafficking.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 90 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reject the need for a comprehensive and humane approach to migration and asylum issues, and instead focus on deterrence and removal of irregular arrivals.

Sentiment - A
