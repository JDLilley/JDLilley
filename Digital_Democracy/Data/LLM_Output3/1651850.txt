Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the asylum system and deter illegal migration. The debate focuses on the Lords amendments to the Bill and the Government's response.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 39 means supporting the Government's plan to create a new offence of knowingly arriving in the UK without permission. The Government argues that this will deter illegal entry and encourage safe and legal routes.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 39 means opposing the Government's plan to create a new offence of knowingly arriving in the UK without permission. The opponents argue that this will criminalise refugees, violate international law and human rights, and undermine the rule of law.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 39 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would introduce a harsher penalty for those who enter the UK irregularly, regardless of their reasons or circumstances. It would also create a two-tier system of asylum based on the mode of arrival, which could discriminate against those who have no other option but to use illegal routes.

Sentiment - A
