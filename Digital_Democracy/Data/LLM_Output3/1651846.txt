Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 23 means supporting the Government's view that LGBT asylum seekers can be removed to countries where they may face persecution, as long as they are discreet about their identity and orientation. The Government argues that this is consistent with international law and UK case law.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 23 means supporting the Lords' view that LGBT asylum seekers should not be removed to countries where they may face serious harm because of who they are. The Lords argue that this is a matter of human rights and dignity, and that the Government's approach is discriminatory and unrealistic.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 23 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would make it harder for LGBT asylum seekers to claim protection in the UK and easier for the Government to deport them to unsafe countries.

Sentiment - A
