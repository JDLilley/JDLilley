Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to disagree with LA 11B means supporting the Government's position that the number of refugees and people in need of protection resettled each year should be based on capacity and assessment, not on a fixed target. The Government argues that this is a flexible and responsive approach.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to disagree with LA 11B means supporting the Lords' amendment that would require the Government to set a target for the number of refugees and people in need of protection resettled each year, and to report on it annually[1]. The Lords argue that this is a humane and accountable approach.

Decision - The Motion to disagree with LA 11B would tighten immigration and borders, as it would give the Government more discretion and control over how many refugees and people in need of protection are admitted to the UK each year, without a clear commitment or transparency.

Sentiment - A
