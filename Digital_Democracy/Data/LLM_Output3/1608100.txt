Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to reform the UK's asylum system and deter irregular arrivals. The debate covers various clauses and amendments related to removal, detention, trafficking and citizenship.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Clause 11 stand part means supporting the Government's proposal to extend the power to detain people who are subject to removal under clause 2. The Government argues that this is necessary to prevent absconding and facilitate removals.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Clause 11 stand part means opposing the Government's proposal to extend the power to detain people who are subject to removal under clause 2. The opposition argues that this is disproportionate, unlawful and harmful to vulnerable people, especially children and victims of trafficking.

Decision - Clause 11 stand part would tighten immigration and borders, as it would increase the scope and duration of detention for people who are deemed inadmissible or have arrived irregularly. It would also limit the access to bail and judicial review for those detained.

Sentiment - A
