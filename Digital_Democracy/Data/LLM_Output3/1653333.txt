Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter and remove illegal migrants who arrive by small boats. The debate focuses on the amendments proposed by the House of Lords, which the Government rejects.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 9B, which would prevent the removal of asylum seekers whose claims are declared inadmissible[1]. The Government argues that this amendment would encourage illegal migrants to game the system and delay their removal[2].

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 9B, which would protect the rights of asylum seekers whose claims are declared inadmissible[1]. The Opposition argues that this amendment would uphold the UK's obligations under international law and prevent the removal of vulnerable people to unsafe countries.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with tighter immigration and borders, as it would enable the Government to remove more illegal migrants who arrive by small boats and deter others from making the journey.

Sentiment - A
