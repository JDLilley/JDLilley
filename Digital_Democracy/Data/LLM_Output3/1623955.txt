Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to reform the UK's asylum system and border security. The debate covers various amendments and clauses proposed by the government and the opposition.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Amendment 2 means supporting an exemption from the duty to remove for people who arrive in the UK from the Republic of Ireland via the land border with Northern Ireland[1]. This is intended to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid creating a hard border.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Amendment 2 means opposing an exemption from the duty to remove for people who arrive in the UK from the Republic of Ireland via the land border with Northern Ireland[1]. This is intended to prevent abuse of the Common Travel Area and ensure equal treatment of all illegal entrants.

Decision - Amendment 2 would soften immigration and borders by creating a loophole for people who enter the UK illegally via Ireland. It would undermine the government's objective of deterring illegal migration and enforcing removals.

Sentiment - B
