Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the conduct of the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was accused of lying to the House and the public about covid-19 gatherings in Downing Street. The debate was followed by a vote on a motion to approve a report by the Privileges Committee that recommended sanctions against Mr Johnson.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the motion and agreeing with the Committee's findings that Mr Johnson deliberately misled the House and committed a serious contempt[1]. It also means upholding the standards and integrity of Parliament and respecting its authority to investigate and punish breaches of privilege.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the motion and disagreeing with the Committee's findings that Mr Johnson deliberately misled the House and committed a serious contempt[1]. It also means challenging the fairness and validity of the Committee's process and questioning its impartiality and credibility.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with accountability and decentralisation in the context of Parliamentary Procedures, because it implies that Members of Parliament are accountable for their actions and words, and that they are subject to the same rules and sanctions as everyone else. It also implies that Parliament has the power and autonomy to regulate its own affairs and discipline its own Members, without interference from the Government or outside influences.

Sentiment - A
