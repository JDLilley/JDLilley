Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter and remove illegal migrants who arrive by small boats. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 33B, which would prevent the removal of LGBT people to certain countries where they fear persecution based on their sexuality[1]. The Government argues that the Bill already provides sufficient protection for such people and that the amendment is unnecessary.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 33B, which would prevent the removal of LGBT people to certain countries where they fear persecution based on their sexuality. The amendment was put forward by the Archbishop of Canterbury and supported by some Opposition peers, who argue that the Bill does not guarantee the safety and dignity of LGBT people in some countries.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 33B is associated with tighter immigration and borders, because it would allow the Government to remove more illegal migrants, including LGBT people, to third countries without regard to their sexual orientation.

Sentiment - A
