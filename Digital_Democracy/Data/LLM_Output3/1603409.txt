Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to stop illegal boat crossings and reform the asylum system in the UK.

For - The supporters of the Bill argue that it is necessary to secure the UK's borders, deter illegal migration, protect genuine refugees, and crack down on criminal smugglers and traffickers.

Against - The opponents of the Bill argue that it is ineffective, inhumane, unlawful, and counterproductive. They claim that it will not stop the boats, but will instead create more suffering, injustice, and chaos in the asylum system.

Decision - The Programme motion is a procedural motion that sets out the timetable and rules for the Bill's passage through Parliament. Voting for it would speed up the Bill's progress and limit the opportunities for scrutiny and amendment. Voting against it would slow down the Bill's progress and allow more time for debate and changes. Therefore, voting for the Programme motion would tighten immigration and borders, while voting against it would soften immigration and borders.

Sentiment - A
