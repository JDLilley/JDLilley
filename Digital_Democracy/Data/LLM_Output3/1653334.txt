Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter illegal entry and remove failed asylum seekers. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 23B, which would prevent the removal of LGBT people to certain countries where they may face persecution[1][2]. The Government argues that the Bill already provides adequate protection for such people and that the amendment is unnecessary.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 23B, which would prevent the removal of LGBT people to certain countries where they may face persecution[1][2]. The opponents argue that the Bill does not guarantee the safety and dignity of such people and that the amendment is essential.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 23B is associated with tighter immigration and borders, because it would allow the Government to remove more people who have entered illegally or have failed their asylum claims, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Sentiment - A
