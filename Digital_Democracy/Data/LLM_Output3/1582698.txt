Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the UK Infrastructure Bank Bill, which aims to establish a bank to invest in infrastructure projects that support net zero and regional growth. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different parties.

For - Voting for New Clause 2 means supporting the requirement for the bank to publish an annual report on the geographical spread and ownership of its investments, and to ensure that every project has a good jobs plan to improve productivity, pay, jobs and living standards.

Against - Voting against New Clause 2 means opposing the additional reporting and planning obligations for the bank, and preferring to keep its objectives clear and focused on climate change and economic growth, without imposing extra criteria or constraints on its operations.

Decision - Voting for New Clause 2 is associated with stimulus and regulation, because it implies that the bank should use public funds to stimulate economic activity and create good jobs across the country, but also that it should be subject to more regulation and scrutiny to ensure accountability and transparency.

Sentiment - B
