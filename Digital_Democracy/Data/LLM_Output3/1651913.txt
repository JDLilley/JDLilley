Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments and the Government's objections to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 93, which would require the Government to publish a 10-year strategy on countering human trafficking and responding to international refugee crises. The Government argues that such a strategy is unnecessary and impractical.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 93, and supporting the Lords' proposal to require the Government to publish a 10-year strategy on countering human trafficking and responding to international refugee crises[1]. The Lords argue that such a strategy is essential and feasible.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 93 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reject the Lords' attempt to make the Government commit to a long-term plan for addressing the root causes of migration and providing safe and legal routes for refugees.

Sentiment - A
