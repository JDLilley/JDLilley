Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments that challenge or modify the Bill.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords amendment 56, which would exempt victims of modern slavery from being removed and denied support[1]. The Government argues that the amendment would undermine the Bill's objective of deterring illegal migration and preventing abuse of the system.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords amendment 56, which would exempt victims of modern slavery from being removed and denied support. The opposition argues that the amendment would protect vulnerable people from being re-trafficked and enable them to co-operate with criminal investigations.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 56 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reduce the scope of protection and support for asylum seekers who are victims of modern slavery, and increase the risk of their removal to third countries or their home countries.

Sentiment - A
