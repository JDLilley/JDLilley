Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments and the Government's objections to them.

For - The Government argues that the Bill is necessary to stop the boats, prevent abuse of the asylum system, and uphold the rule of law[1]. They say that Lords amendment 103, which requires the National Crime Agency to tackle immigration crime, is redundant and interferes with operational independence[2].

Against - The Opposition argues that the Bill is cruel, counterproductive, and breaches international law. They say that Lords amendment 103, which requires the National Crime Agency to tackle immigration crime, is essential to combat the criminal gangs that exploit vulnerable people and undermine security[2].

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 103 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reject a measure that aims to enhance law enforcement against human trafficking and smuggling.

Sentiment - A
