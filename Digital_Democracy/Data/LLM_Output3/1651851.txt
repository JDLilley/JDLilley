Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments that seek to protect the rights and welfare of refugees, children, and trafficking victims.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 50, which limits the power to transfer children out of local authority care to cases where it is necessary for their welfare. The Government argues that this amendment would restrict its ability to provide suitable accommodation for unaccompanied children.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 50, and supporting the Lords' view that children should not be transferred to Home Office accommodation unless it is in their best interests. The Opposition argues that this amendment would protect children from being placed in hotels or detention centres, where they are vulnerable to exploitation and harm.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 50 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would give the Government more discretion to move children out of local authority care, regardless of their welfare needs. It would also undermine the principle of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, which is enshrined in the Children Act 1989.

Sentiment - A
