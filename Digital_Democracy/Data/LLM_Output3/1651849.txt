Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response.

For - Voting for the Government amendments (a) and (b) in lieu of Lords amendments 31, 35 and 36 would mean that unaccompanied children who arrive irregularly could be detained for up to eight days before applying for bail, and could be transferred to accommodation provided by the Home Office if necessary. This would enable the Government to manage the influx of children more effectively and prevent them from absconding or being exploited by traffickers.

Against - Voting against the Government amendments (a) and (b) in lieu of Lords amendments 31, 35 and 36 would mean that unaccompanied children who arrive irregularly would retain the current 24-hour limit on detention, and could not be transferred to accommodation provided by the Home Office unless it is in their best interests. This would protect the rights and welfare of children who are seeking asylum and ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect.

Decision - The Government amendments (a) and (b) in lieu of Lords amendments 31, 35 and 36 would tighten immigration and borders, as they would make it harder for unaccompanied children who arrive irregularly to access support and protection in the UK, and increase the risk of them being removed to third countries.

Sentiment - A
