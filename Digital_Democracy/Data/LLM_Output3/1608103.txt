Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to reform the UK's asylum system and deter irregular arrivals. The debate covers various clauses and amendments related to removal, detention, trafficking and citizenship.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: New Clause 27 means supporting the proposal to require the Secretary of State to publish a strategy for safe and legal routes for asylum seekers within six months of the Act being passed. The supporters argue that this would uphold the UK's humanitarian obligations and reduce dangerous crossings.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: New Clause 27 means opposing the proposal to require the Secretary of State to publish a strategy for safe and legal routes for asylum seekers within six months of the Act being passed. The opponents argue that this would undermine the Government's efforts to deter irregular migration and create a fairer system.

Decision - The New Clause 27 would soften immigration and borders, as it would create more opportunities for asylum seekers to reach the UK through official channels, rather than relying on smugglers or illegal entry. It would also challenge the Government's plan to differentiate between refugees based on their mode of arrival.

Sentiment - B
