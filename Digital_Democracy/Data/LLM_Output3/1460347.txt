Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the asylum system and deter illegal migration. The debate focuses on the Lords amendments that the Government wants to reject.

For - The Government argues that the Lords amendments are unnecessary, unacceptable or unconstitutional. They claim that the Bill is compatible with the refugee convention and international law, and that it will protect vulnerable people and stop dangerous channel crossings.

Against - The Opposition argues that the Lords amendments are essential to ensure compliance with the refugee convention and human rights. They criticise the Government for failing to provide safe and legal routes, negotiate a returns agreement, process cases efficiently and treat asylum seekers with dignity.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 5D would tighten immigration and borders, as it would remove the duty of the courts to declare incompatibility with the refugee convention if the Bill breaches it.

Sentiment - A
