Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the UK Infrastructure Bank Bill, which aims to establish and regulate a new bank to support infrastructure projects. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different parties.

For - Voting for amendment 2 means supporting the requirement that the Treasury must gain the express consent of the devolved authorities before making regulations that affect their legislative competence. This amendment seeks to protect the devolution settlement and ensure policy alignment between the UK Infrastructure Bank and the devolved banks.

Against - Voting against amendment 2 means opposing the requirement that the Treasury must gain the express consent of the devolved authorities before making regulations that affect their legislative competence. This amendment could be seen as limiting the Treasury's flexibility and efficiency in regulating the UK Infrastructure Bank and its operations across the UK.

Decision - Voting for amendment 2 is associated with austerity and regulation, because it imposes a higher threshold for the Treasury to make changes to the UK Infrastructure Bank's framework and functions. It could also constrain the bank's ability to respond to changing economic circumstances and opportunities.

Sentiment - B
