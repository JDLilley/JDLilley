Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to stop illegal arrivals and remove them to a safe third country such as Rwanda.

For - The supporters of the Bill argue that it is necessary to secure the UK's borders, reform the broken asylum system, end dangerous small boat crossings, deter people smugglers and uphold international law.

Against - The opponents of the Bill claim that it fails to meet its core objectives, lacks effective measures to tackle criminal activity, increases the backlog of asylum cases, leaves victims of modern slavery without protection, undermines international co-operation and violates human rights.

Decision - The Bill would tighten immigration and borders by making it harder for illegal entrants to access the UK's asylum system and by enabling their swift removal to a third country.

Sentiment - A
