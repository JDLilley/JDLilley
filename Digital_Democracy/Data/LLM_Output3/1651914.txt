Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various Lords amendments that challenge or modify the Bill.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 95, which would prevent the removal of unaccompanied children to third countries without their consent and a best interests assessment.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 95, and supporting the Lords' intention to protect unaccompanied children from being removed to third countries that may not be safe or suitable for them.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 95 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would give the Government more power to remove unaccompanied children who arrive irregularly, regardless of their wishes or welfare.

Sentiment - A
