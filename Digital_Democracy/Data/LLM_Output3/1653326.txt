This is the summary of the current web page context:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter illegal entry and remove failed asylum seekers. The debate focuses on the Government's motion to disagree with some amendments made by the House of Lords[1].

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion and rejecting the Lords amendments. It means agreeing with the Government's plan to detain and remove illegal migrants to their home country or a safe third country, and to create a credible deterrent[2].

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion and accepting the Lords amendments. It means disagreeing with the Government's plan and arguing that it is unworkable, unlawful, inhumane, and ineffective. It means advocating for more safe and legal routes, and more protection for vulnerable groups.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with tighter immigration and borders, because it supports the Government's intention to reduce illegal entry and increase removals. It also supports the Government's view that inaction is not an option and that the UK should have more control over its borders.

Sentiment - A
