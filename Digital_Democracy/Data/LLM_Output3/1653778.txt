Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, which aims to address the legacy of the conflict and promote reconciliation. The debate covers various amendments to the Bill and the arguments for and against them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords amendment 44, which would remove the provision of conditional immunity from prosecution for those who provide information to the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR)[1]. The Government argues that conditional immunity is a crucial aspect of the information recovery process and that it has a precedent in previous measures to deal with the past[2].

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion and supporting Lords amendment 44, which would delete the provision of conditional immunity from prosecution for those who provide information to the ICRIR[1]. Those who support this amendment argue that conditional immunity is a form of amnesty that undermines the rule of law, the rights of victims and families, and the prospects of justice and accountability.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in this division is not clearly associated with either globalisation or protectionism, as it relates more to the domestic issue of dealing with the legacy of the troubles in Northern Ireland. However, one could argue that voting 'Aye' could be seen as a way of strengthening ties with the European Union and other foreign affairs, as it could be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill and co-operation towards the Irish Government and other international stakeholders who have an interest in the peace process and human rights.

Sentiment - C
