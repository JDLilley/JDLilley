Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to stop illegal boat crossings and remove asylum seekers to Rwanda. The Home Secretary argues that the Bill is necessary, lawful and humane, while the Opposition criticises it as ineffective, unlawful and inhumane.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Money means supporting the financial provisions of the Bill, which include expanding detention capacity, funding the partnership with Rwanda, and imposing penalties on illegal entrants and carriers.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Money means opposing the financial provisions of the Bill, which are seen as wasteful, harmful and disproportionate. The Opposition argues that the money should be spent on tackling the criminal gangs, clearing the asylum backlog and improving resettlement schemes.

Decision - The Money division would tighten immigration and borders, as it would enable the implementation of the Bill's measures to deter and remove illegal entrants, and reduce the incentives for making dangerous journeys to the UK.

Sentiment - A
