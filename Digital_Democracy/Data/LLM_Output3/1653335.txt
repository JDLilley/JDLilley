Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter illegal entry and remove failed asylum seekers. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendments 36C and 36D, which would limit the detention of unaccompanied children and family groups[1]. The Government argues that these amendments would create loopholes for migrants and smugglers to exploit and prevent effective removals.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendments 36C and 36D, which would protect unaccompanied children and family groups from detention[1]. The opponents argue that these amendments are necessary to safeguard the rights and welfare of vulnerable migrants and uphold international obligations.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with tighter immigration and borders, as it would give the Government more powers to detain and remove illegal migrants, regardless of their age or family status. It would also signal a rejection of the Lords' amendments, which are seen as more lenient and humane.

Sentiment - A
