Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill, which aims to end the special status of retained EU law on the UK statute book by 2023 and give Ministers powers to revoke or replace it[1].

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Third Reading means supporting the Bill and its objectives of restoring parliamentary sovereignty, removing legal uncertainty, and simplifying the statute book. It also means trusting the Government to use its powers responsibly and in accordance with the devolution settlements.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Third Reading means opposing the Bill and its objectives of ending the special status of retained EU law. It also means expressing concern about the wide and unaccountable powers given to Ministers, the potential impact on workers' rights, environmental standards, consumer protections, and legal certainty, and the lack of consultation with the devolved authorities.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Third Reading is associated with protectionism and independence from the European Union and other foreign affairs. This is because it implies a desire to diverge from EU law and standards, to assert UK sovereignty over its own laws, and to reduce the influence of international agreements and obligations on UK legislation.

Sentiment - B
