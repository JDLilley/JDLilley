Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Public Order Bill, which aims to introduce new offences and powers related to protests and public order. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on New Clause 4 means supporting the introduction of an injunction to prevent serious disruption to the effective movement of essential goods or services caused by a public procession or assembly[1]. The supporters of this clause argue that it is necessary to protect the public interest and the rights of others from being affected by disruptive protests.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on New Clause 4 means opposing the introduction of an injunction to prevent serious disruption to the effective movement of essential goods or services caused by a public procession or assembly[1]. The opponents of this clause argue that it is disproportionate, unnecessary and infringes on the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on New Clause 4 is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because it would give the police and other authorities more power to restrict and prevent protests that they deem to be seriously disruptive, and it would impose civil sanctions on protesters who breach the injunction.

Sentiment - A
