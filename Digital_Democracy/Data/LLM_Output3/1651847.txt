Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate focuses on the Lords amendments that challenge the Government's proposals.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 31 means supporting the Government's plan to detain unaccompanied children who arrive irregularly for more than 24 hours. The Government argues that this is necessary to prevent absconding and safeguarding risks.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 31 means supporting the Lords' view that detaining unaccompanied children for more than 24 hours is unacceptable and harmful. The Lords argue that this violates the rights of the child and the principle of the best interests of the child.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 31 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would allow the Government to detain unaccompanied children who arrive irregularly for longer periods, potentially discouraging future arrivals and facilitating removals.

Sentiment - A
