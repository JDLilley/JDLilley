Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - The Government and its supporters argue that the Bill is necessary to deter illegal and dangerous journeys, protect the UK's security and sovereignty, and create a fairer and more efficient system. They disagree with LA 25B, which would limit the power to deprive citizenship from people involved in modern slavery.

Against - The Opposition and some Conservative rebels argue that the Bill is inhumane, unlawful, and ineffective. They support LA 25B, which would ensure that the power to deprive citizenship is used only in exceptional circumstances and with due regard to human rights and international obligations.

Decision - The motion to disagree with LA 25B would tighten immigration and borders, as it would give the Government more discretion to remove citizenship from people who are deemed to pose a threat or risk, regardless of their involvement in modern slavery.

Sentiment - A
