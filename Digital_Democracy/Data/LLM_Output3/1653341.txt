This is the summary of the text file in the current web page context:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter and remove illegal migrants who arrive by small boats. The debate focuses on the Government's motion to disagree with several amendments made by the House of Lords[1].

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendments 107B and 107C, which call for a more compassionate and international approach to refugees[2]. The Government argues that the UK already has a proud record of providing safe and legal routes, and that the Bill is necessary to stop the boats and protect the borders.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords Amendments 107B and 107C, which call for a more compassionate and international approach to refugees[2]. The Opposition argues that the Bill is unworkable, inhumane and unlawful, and that it will not deter or prevent illegal migration, but only create more chaos and suffering.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with tighter immigration and borders, because it supports the Government's plan to create a strong deterrent for illegal migrants and to remove them swiftly to their home country or a safe third country.

Sentiment - A
