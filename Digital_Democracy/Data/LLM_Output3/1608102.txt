Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file contains a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to reform the UK's asylum system and deter irregular arrivals. The debate covers various clauses and amendments related to removal, detention, support and citizenship of migrants.

For - The supporters of New Clause 21 argue that it would create a statutory duty for the Home Secretary to establish safe and legal routes for asylum seekers, especially unaccompanied children, and to report annually on the progress. They claim that this would reduce the reliance on dangerous and illegal crossings and uphold the UK's humanitarian obligations.

Against - The opponents of New Clause 21 contend that it is unnecessary and impractical, as the Home Secretary already has the power to create safe and legal routes under existing legislation and international agreements. They also assert that the clause would undermine the Government's efforts to deter irregular migration and prevent abuse of the asylum system.

Decision - Voting for New Clause 21 would soften immigration and borders, as it would make it easier for asylum seekers to enter and stay in the UK through designated routes, rather than being subject to removal or inadmissibility.

Sentiment - B
