Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to reform the UK's asylum system and deter irregular arrivals. The debate covers various amendments and clauses related to removal, detention, and support of asylum seekers.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Amendment 288 means supporting the removal of potential victims of sexual exploitation from the provisions requiring them to be removed[1]. This amendment seeks to protect vulnerable people from being sent back to unsafe countries or territories.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Amendment 288 means opposing the removal of potential victims of sexual exploitation from the provisions requiring them to be removed. This amendment seeks to prevent abuse of the system by people who may falsely claim to be victims of sexual exploitation[1].

Decision - The Amendment 288 would soften immigration and borders, as it would create an exception for a category of people who would otherwise be subject to removal under the Bill. It would also show more compassion and respect for human rights of asylum seekers who have suffered sexual exploitation.

Sentiment - B
