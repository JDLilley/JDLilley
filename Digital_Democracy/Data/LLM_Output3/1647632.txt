Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which aims to tailor financial services regulation to UK markets after Brexit[1]. The debate covers various amendments made by the Lords, some of which are accepted and some rejected by the Government.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 7 means supporting the Government's view that the regulators should only have regard to the net zero emissions target and not other environmental or social targets. The Government argues that this would avoid overburdening the regulators with vague or irrelevant considerations.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 7 means supporting the Lords' view that the regulators should have regard to other targets such as conservation and enhancement of the natural environment, biodiversity, human rights and sustainable development[2]. The Lords argue that this would align with the Government's own commitments and international obligations.

Decision - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 7 is associated with austerity and regulation, because it limits the scope of the regulators' objectives and restricts their ability to take into account wider impacts of financial services on society and nature. It also implies a lack of ambition and innovation in addressing the environmental and social challenges facing the UK and the world.

Sentiment - B
