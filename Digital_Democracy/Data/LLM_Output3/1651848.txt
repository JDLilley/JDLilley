Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove asylum seekers to third countries. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 33 means supporting the Government's plan to extend the detention of unaccompanied children from 24 hours to 96 hours. The Government argues that this is necessary to prevent absconding and facilitate removals.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 33 means opposing the Government's plan and retaining the current 24-hour limit on the detention of unaccompanied children[1]. The opposition argues that this is a humane and sensible approach that respects the rights and welfare of vulnerable children.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 33 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would allow the Government to detain unaccompanied children for longer periods and potentially remove them to third countries without adequate safeguards.

Sentiment - A
