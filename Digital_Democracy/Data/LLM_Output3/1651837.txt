Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the asylum system and deter illegal migration. The debate focuses on the Lords amendments to the Bill and the Government's response.

For - The Government argues that the Bill is necessary to stop the boats, protect the public, and comply with international obligations[1]. The Government rejects Lords amendment 6, which would allow asylum claims from irregular arrivals to be admissible, as it would undermine the objective of creating safe and legal routes.

Against - The Opposition and some Conservative MPs argue that the Bill is cruel, counterproductive, and unlawful. They support Lords amendment 6, which would prevent the creation of a two-tier system of asylum based on mode of arrival, and uphold the principle of assessing claims on their merits.

Decision - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 6 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would make it harder for irregular arrivals to claim asylum in the UK, and increase the possibility of removal or detention.

Sentiment - A
