Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to deter irregular arrivals and remove inadmissible asylum seekers. The debate focuses on the Lords amendments that challenge the Bill's provisions.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 9 means supporting the Government's plan to deny asylum claims from people who enter the UK illegally, unless they are removed within six months. This is intended to discourage dangerous journeys and deter people smugglers.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords amendment 9 means supporting the Lords' proposal to accept asylum claims from people who enter the UK illegally, if they are not removed within six months. This is intended to prevent indefinite limbo, respect human rights and uphold international law.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 9 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would create a two-tier system of asylum based on the mode of entry and reduce the chances of regularising the status of irregular migrants.

Sentiment - A
