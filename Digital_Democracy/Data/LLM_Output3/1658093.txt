Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Energy Bill, which aims to promote low-carbon energy sources and improve energy efficiency. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on New Clause 39 means supporting the introduction of a nuclear energy financing scheme, which would allow the government to enter into contracts with private investors to fund new nuclear power plants. The supporters argue that this would ensure long-term energy security and help meet net zero targets.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on New Clause 39 means opposing the introduction of a nuclear energy financing scheme, which would allow the government to enter into contracts with private investors to fund new nuclear power plants. The opponents argue that this would expose taxpayers to financial risks and undermine the development of cheaper and cleaner renewable energy sources.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on New Clause 39 is associated with prioritising economic growth and development in the context of Environment & Energy, because it would enable the construction of new nuclear power plants that could provide reliable and low-carbon electricity, but at a high cost and with potential environmental and social impacts.
