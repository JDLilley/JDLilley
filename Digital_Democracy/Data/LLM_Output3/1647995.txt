Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament about a bill that would ban social transition practices in schools and require parental consent for gender identity education. The bill was proposed by Andrew Bridgen and opposed by Ben Bradshaw.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the bill, which claims to protect children from political indoctrination, safeguard their innocence, and uphold parental rights. The bill argues that social transition is harmful and unnatural, and that gender identity is a controversial theory.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means rejecting the bill, which is seen as a cynical attempt to stoke the culture wars and deny the existence of trans and non-binary people. The bill would violate the rights and well-being of LGBT students and their families, and undermine the professional judgment of schools.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Ten-Minute Rule Bill is associated with limiting Education & Learning, because it would prevent schools from providing accurate and inclusive information about gender diversity, and restrict the freedom and autonomy of students to express their identity.

Sentiment - B
