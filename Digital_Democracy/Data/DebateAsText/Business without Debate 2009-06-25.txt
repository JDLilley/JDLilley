Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con)
On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The purpose of these motions is to provide for a uniform situation across England in which Regional Grand Committees are allowed to meet at certain appointed times. Following the Government’s recent defeat, it appears that that policy is in complete disarray, and we now have inequity across England. Is it in your power to ask the Leader of the House to make a statement—hopefully, one in which she announces that she intends to withdraw all the motions and go back to the drawing board?

Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst)
I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that no such power is vested in the Chair. We must proceed with the business on the Order Paper. If the next motion is moved, the House will come to a decision.
