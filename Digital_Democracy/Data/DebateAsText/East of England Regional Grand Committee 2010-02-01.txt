Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord)
We come to the motion on section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993. [Interruption.] Motion not moved.

Philip Davies (Shipley) (Con)
On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We have here a ludicrous situation in which the Government are trying to sneak things through at the end of the day’s business. They are quite happy to move motions when there is no time for debate, but when there is roughly an hour to debate an issue, they do not want to move the motion. Can anything be done to make sure that motions on the Order Paper are moved when there is time to debate them in the House?

Mr. Deputy Speaker
I say to the hon. Gentleman that we have done everything within the normal rules of the House; the Government’s actions are a matter for the Government.
