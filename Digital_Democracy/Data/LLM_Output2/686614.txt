Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which would allow the Prime Minister to trigger Article 50 and start the process of leaving the EU. The debate covers various amendments and issues related to the UK's withdrawal.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Committee of the whole House Amdt 11 means supporting an amendment that would require the Prime Minister to consult with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland before issuing any notification under Article 50. This would respect the different views and interests of the nations of the UK.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Committee of the whole House Amdt 11 means opposing an amendment that would require the Prime Minister to consult with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland before issuing any notification under Article 50. This would undermine the sovereignty of Parliament and the authority of the Prime Minister to negotiate on behalf of the whole UK.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Committee of the whole House Amdt 11 is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other Foreign Affairs, because it would acknowledge the diversity and interdependence of the UK and its constituent nations, and seek to maintain a constructive relationship with the EU and its member states.

Sentiment - A
