Hello, this is Bing. I have reviewed the text file open in your current webpage and here is my response:

Summary - The text file contains proposed new clauses to amend the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, which ends free movement rights for EEA and Swiss nationals in the UK. The clauses cover various issues such as family reunion, data protection, health and social care workers, and devolution.

For - The MPs who voted for (Ayes) in the division: Third Reading supported the Bill as a way to deliver on the Brexit referendum result and to create a fairer and more effective immigration system that attracts skills and talent from around the world.

Against - The MPs who voted against (Noes) in the division: Third Reading opposed the Bill as a harmful and unnecessary measure that would end the rights of millions of people, damage the economy and public services, and undermine the devolved nations.

Decision - The Third Reading of the Bill would tighten immigration and borders, as it would end free movement rights for EEA and Swiss nationals, introduce new visa requirements and fees, and apply hostile environment measures to them.

Sentiment - A
