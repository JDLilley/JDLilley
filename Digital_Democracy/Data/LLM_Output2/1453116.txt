For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 25 means supporting the Government's plan to introduce a new offence of knowingly arriving in the UK without permission. The Government argues that this will deter illegal entry and break the business model of criminal smugglers.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 25 means opposing the Government's plan to introduce a new offence of knowingly arriving in the UK without permission. The opponents argue that this will criminalise refugees who have no choice but to seek asylum in the UK and violate international law.

Sentiment - A
