Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Serious Crime Bill, which aims to tackle various offences such as child sexual exploitation, female genital mutilation, and money laundering. The debate covers different amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting 'Ayes' for new clause NC1 means supporting the introduction of mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse by professionals who work with children. This would create a legal duty to inform a relevant authority of any harm or risk of harm to a child, and impose penalties for failing to do so.

Against - Voting 'Noes' for new clause NC1 means opposing the introduction of mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse by professionals who work with children. This would maintain the current system of professional discretion and judgement, and avoid creating a culture of fear and over-reporting that could overwhelm the authorities and harm the relationship between professionals and families.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' for new clause NC1 is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because it would increase the involvement of the police and other authorities in investigating and prosecuting cases of child abuse, and create a new offence for professionals who fail to report their suspicions.

Sentiment - A
