Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on a bill that would end free movement of EU citizens to the UK and change the immigration and social security rules after Brexit. The debate focuses on an amendment that would protect the rights of unaccompanied child refugees to reunite with their family members in the UK.

For - The supporters of the amendment argue that it is a humanitarian duty to help vulnerable children who have fled conflict and persecution and have relatives in the UK. They claim that the existing immigration rules are too restrictive and that the government's proposed review is too vague and too late. They warn that without the amendment, more children will risk their lives in dangerous journeys or fall prey to smugglers and traffickers.

Against - The opponents of the amendment contend that it is well-intentioned but unnecessary and impractical. They assert that the government is committed to the principle of family unity and to supporting safe and legal routes for people seeking protection[1]. They point out that the UK has a proud record of resettling refugees and granting family reunion visas, and that these routes will continue after the transition period. They also stress that the bill is essential to end free movement and implement the new immigration system as planned.

Decision - The Lords amendment 4B motion to disagree would tighten immigration and borders, as it would remove a legal guarantee for unaccompanied child refugees to join their family members in the UK. It would also reduce the scope of parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation on this issue. It would make it harder for children who are eligible for asylum to access a safe and legal route to the UK, and potentially increase their vulnerability and desperation.

Sentiment - A
