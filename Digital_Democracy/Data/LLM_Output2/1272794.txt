Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the European Union (Future Relationship) Bill, which was passed by a large majority. The Bill implements the trade and co-operation agreement between the UK and the EU after Brexit.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Bill and the agreement, which provides tariff-free and quota-free trade with the EU, as well as co-operation on security, health, and other issues. It also means respecting the will of the people who voted to leave the EU in 2016.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Bill and the agreement, which leaves many aspects of the UK-EU relationship unresolved, such as services, fisheries, and Northern Ireland. It also means rejecting the rushed and undemocratic process of passing the Bill in one day without proper scrutiny or amendments.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with protectionism and independence from the EU and other foreign affairs, as it means leaving the EU's single market and customs union, ending the free movement of people, and reclaiming sovereignty over UK laws and regulations.

Sentiment - B
