Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Finance Bill 2020, which introduces various tax measures. The debate covers amendments and new clauses on topics such as digital services tax, coronavirus support payments, pension age, residence test, and public interest business protection tax.

For - Voting for Amendment 20 means supporting the Treasury's power to delay the introduction of the multinational top-up tax, which is a new tax on large multinational businesses that operate in the UK and have low effective tax rates. This amendment is backed by some Conservative MPs who favour a more flexible approach to taxation.

Against - Voting against Amendment 20 means opposing the Treasury's power to delay the introduction of the multinational top-up tax, which is a new tax on large multinational businesses that operate in the UK and have low effective tax rates. This amendment is opposed by some Labour MPs who favour a more robust approach to taxation.

Decision - Voting for Amendment 20 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies that the Treasury can postpone or cancel the new tax if it considers that it would harm the economic recovery or competitiveness of the UK.

Sentiment - A
