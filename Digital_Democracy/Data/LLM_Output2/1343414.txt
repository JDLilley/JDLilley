Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which covers various aspects of law and order in the UK. The debate covers topics such as protest rights, sexual harassment, abortion, and violence against workers.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on New Clause 91 means supporting the creation of a new offence of assaulting or threatening a retail worker who is enforcing the law on age-restricted sales. This would protect workers from abuse and violence when they are doing their job.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on New Clause 91 means opposing the creation of a new offence of assaulting or threatening a retail worker who is enforcing the law on age-restricted sales. This would avoid creating a hierarchy of victims and maintain consistency with existing offences of assault and public order.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on New Clause 91 is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because it would give the police more authority to arrest and charge offenders who target retail workers, and it would increase the penalties for such offences.

Sentiment - A
