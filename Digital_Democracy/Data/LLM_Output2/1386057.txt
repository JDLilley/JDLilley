Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the UK's immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: New Clause 6 means supporting an exemption for child victims of modern slavery, exploitation or trafficking from some of the provisions in Part 5 of the Bill[2]. The supporters argue that this would protect the rights and best interests of vulnerable children.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: New Clause 6 means opposing an exemption for child victims of modern slavery, exploitation or trafficking from some of the provisions in Part 5 of the Bill[2]. The opponents argue that this would create a loophole for abuse and fraud by adult claimants posing as children.

Decision - The New Clause 6 would soften immigration and borders by providing more leniency and support for child victims of modern slavery, exploitation or trafficking[1]. It would also reduce the risk of deterring or disqualifying genuine victims from seeking protection.

Sentiment - B
