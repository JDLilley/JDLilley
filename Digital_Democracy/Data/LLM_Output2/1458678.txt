Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - The Government and its supporters argue that voting for the motion to disagree with LA 5B, which would allow asylum seekers to work after six months, is necessary to prevent abuse of the system, discourage illegal journeys, and protect the economic migration scheme.

Against - The Opposition and some Conservative rebels argue that voting against the motion to disagree with LA 5B, which would allow asylum seekers to work after six months, is humane, fair, and beneficial for integration, mental health, and public finances.

Decision - The motion to disagree with LA 5B would tighten immigration and borders, as it would maintain the current restrictions on asylum seekers' right to work and deter them from coming to the UK.

Sentiment - A
