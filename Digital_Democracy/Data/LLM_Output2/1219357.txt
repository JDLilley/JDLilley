Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file contains documents related to the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, which aims to end free movement of persons from the EU, EEA and Switzerland and make changes to social security co-ordination after Brexit.

For - The supporters of Keir Starmer's New Clause 13 argued that it would delay the application of no recourse to public funds rules for EEA and Swiss nationals during the Covid-19 pandemic and until Parliament decides, to protect their health and welfare.

Against - The opponents of Keir Starmer's New Clause 13 claimed that it was unnecessary and inappropriate, as the government already has the power to grant access to public funds on a case-by-case basis and has provided other forms of support for migrants affected by the pandemic.

Decision - Keir Starmer's New Clause 13 would have softened immigration and borders, as it would have allowed EEA and Swiss nationals who have lost free movement rights to access social security benefits during the Covid-19 crisis and beyond, without being subject to immigration control.

Sentiment - B
