For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Third Reading means supporting the Bill and its objectives to keep the public safe, crack down on criminals, back the police, prevent serious violence, and update the laws on public order and sex offenders. It also means rejecting some of the amendments proposed by the Opposition and other Members.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Third Reading means opposing the Bill and its implications for civil liberties, human rights, and democracy. It also means supporting some of the amendments proposed by the Opposition and other Members, such as creating a new offence of sexual harassment in public places, decriminalising abortion, and protecting Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities from discrimination.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Third Reading is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, strengthening Crime & Justice. The Bill gives more discretion and authority to the police to manage protests, impose sentences, and monitor sex offenders.
