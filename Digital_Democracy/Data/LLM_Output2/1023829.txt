Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill to create an agency for trade and development. The bill was proposed by a Conservative MP and opposed by a Labour MP. The bill was rejected by a large majority.

For - Voting for the bill means supporting the idea of establishing an agency that would coordinate trade and development policies between two departments, and conduct analysis and consultations on trade agreements with developing countries. The bill aims to promote shared prosperity and make poverty history.

Against - Voting against the bill means rejecting the idea of creating another bureaucratic organisation that would undermine the existing Department for International Development and its focus on poverty eradication. The bill also reflects a self-interested trade agenda that is linked to Brexit and ignores the benefits of EU co-operation.

Decision - Voting for the bill is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies a belief that trade liberalisation and economic growth are the best ways to help developing countries and reduce poverty. It also suggests a preference for bilateral trade deals over multilateral arrangements.

Sentiment - A
