Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Trade Bill, which aims to ensure continuity of trade agreements after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs to enhance scrutiny and consultation on trade policy.

For - Voting for New Clause 3 means supporting a parliamentary scrutiny and consent process for all new free trade agreements[1]. This would require the Government to conduct impact assessments, publish draft mandates, and seek approval from both Houses of Parliament before and after negotiations.

Against - Voting against New Clause 3 means rejecting the proposed scrutiny and consent process for new free trade agreements. This would allow the Government to negotiate and ratify trade agreements without the need for parliamentary approval or amendment, as long as they are consistent with existing EU agreements.

Decision - Voting for New Clause 3 is associated with regulation, as it would impose more checks and balances on the Government's trade policy and limit its discretion to make substantial changes to existing trade agreements without parliamentary oversight.

Sentiment - B
