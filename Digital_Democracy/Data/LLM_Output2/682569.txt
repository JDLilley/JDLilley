Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file contains excerpts from a debate in the UK Parliament on the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which would allow the Prime Minister to trigger Article 50 and start the Brexit process. The debate covers various political, economic and constitutional issues related to leaving the EU.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Second Reading - Mr Robertson's Amendment means supporting the amendment proposed by Angus Robertson, the leader of the SNP in Westminster, which would decline to give a second reading to the Bill unless certain conditions are met, such as securing the agreement of the devolved administrations, publishing a White Paper on the Government's plans, and ensuring a meaningful vote for Parliament on the final deal.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Second Reading - Mr Robertson's Amendment means opposing the amendment and allowing the Bill to proceed to the next stage of scrutiny. This would indicate acceptance of the referendum result and respect for the Government's timetable to invoke Article 50 by the end of March 2017, without imposing additional requirements or constraints on the negotiation process.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Second Reading - Mr Robertson's Amendment is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other foreign affairs. The amendment reflects a desire to maintain close co-operation and alignment with the EU on various policy areas, such as trade, security, human rights and climate change. It also recognises the importance of multilateralism and consultation with different stakeholders within the UK and abroad.

Sentiment - A
