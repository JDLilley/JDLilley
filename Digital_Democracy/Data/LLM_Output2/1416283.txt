Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Judicial Review and Courts Bill, which aims to reform the judicial review process and the coroners system in the UK. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Amendment 22 means supporting the Government's proposal to exclude judicial review of decisions made by the Upper Tribunal on permission to appeal from the First-tier Tribunal. This would reduce the number of unmeritorious cases and save time and resources.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Amendment 22 means opposing the Government's proposal and preserving the right of claimants to seek judicial review of decisions made by the Upper Tribunal on permission to appeal from the First-tier Tribunal[1]. This would protect access to justice and judicial oversight of the tribunal system.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Amendment 22 is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because it would limit the ability of individuals to challenge decisions made by public authorities, such as immigration and asylum authorities, that may affect their rights and freedoms.

Sentiment - A
