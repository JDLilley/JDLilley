Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the UK's immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Amendment 98 means supporting the removal of clause 10, which restricts the entitlement to British citizenship for children born stateless in the UK[1]. The supporters argue that clause 10 violates the UK's international obligations and harms the rights and welfare of stateless children.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Amendment 98 means opposing the removal of clause 10, which restricts the entitlement to British citizenship for children born stateless in the UK[1]. The opponents argue that clause 10 is necessary to prevent abuse of the citizenship system and to deter illegal immigration.

Decision - Amendment 98 would soften immigration and borders, as it would make it easier for stateless children born in the UK to acquire British citizenship and enjoy the benefits and protections that come with it. It would also align with the UK's commitments under the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

Sentiment - B
