Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Trade Bill, which deals with the UK's trade policy after Brexit. The main issue is whether the UK should sign trade deals with countries that commit genocide.

For - Voting for the amendment means supporting the government's position that Parliament should have a role in scrutinising trade deals with countries where credible reports of genocide exist, but not giving a judicial committee the power to make preliminary determinations of genocide.

Against - Voting against the amendment means supporting the Lords' position that an ad hoc parliamentary judicial committee, composed of former judges, should have the power to make preliminary determinations of genocide and trigger a debate on whether to proceed with trade negotiations with such countries.

Decision - Voting for the amendment is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies that the UK is willing to prioritise its commercial interests over its human rights obligations, and that it does not want to restrict its trade policy by giving too much power to an unelected committee.

Sentiment - A
