Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the asylum system and deter illegal migration. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 11 means supporting the Government's view that the number of refugees resettled each year should not be fixed at 10,000, but should depend on various factors, such as capacity, international situation and ability to care for people properly.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 11 means opposing the Government's view and favouring a more generous approach to refugee resettlement, which would commit the UK to resettle at least 10,000 refugees each year, regardless of other considerations.

Decision - The Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 11 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would reduce the UK's obligation to resettle refugees and make it more flexible and discretionary for the Government to decide how many people to admit each year.

Sentiment - A
