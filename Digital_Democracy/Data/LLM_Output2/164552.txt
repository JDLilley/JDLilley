Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Childcare Payments Bill, which aims to provide tax-free child care support to working parents. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by the opposition.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the new clause NC2, which would extend the free entitlement of child care for three and four-year-olds from 15 to 25 hours a week for working parents[1]. This would benefit about 500,000 children and help parents with the rising costs of child care.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means rejecting the new clause NC2, which would cost Â£800 million a year and be funded by increasing the bank levy. This would be unfair to the banking sector and undermine the Government's existing scheme of providing top-up payments for child care costs.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with greater spending on and provision of welfare and social housing, as it would increase public investment in early years education and support low-income families who struggle to afford child care. It would also reduce inequality and improve social mobility for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Sentiment - A
