For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Ed Davey's amendment means rejecting the bill and supporting the maintenance of the triple lock. It also means calling for more benefits for pensioners and low-income workers, such as making the universal credit uplift permanent.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Ed Davey's amendment means approving the bill and agreeing to break the manifesto commitment on the triple lock.
