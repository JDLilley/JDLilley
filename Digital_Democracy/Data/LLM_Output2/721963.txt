Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill in the UK Parliament. The bill contains measures on tax, spending, and digitalisation of the tax system. The opposition criticises the bill for favouring the rich and harming the economy.

For - Voting for the reasoned amendment means rejecting the bill and calling for a fairer and more sustainable tax system that supports public services, small businesses, and living standards. It also means opposing the Government's hard Brexit strategy and tax haven plans.

Against - Voting against the reasoned amendment means supporting the bill and its provisions on reducing the deficit, tackling tax avoidance and evasion, investing in skills and infrastructure, and adapting to the changing ways of working. It also means backing the Government's plan for Britain and its negotiations on exiting the EU.

Decision - Voting for the reasoned amendment is associated with austerity and regulation, as it implies a preference for higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, more public spending, and more protection for workers and consumers. Voting against the reasoned amendment is associated with stimulus and the free market, as it implies a preference for lower taxes, fiscal discipline, and more flexibility and competitiveness in the economy.

Sentiment - A
