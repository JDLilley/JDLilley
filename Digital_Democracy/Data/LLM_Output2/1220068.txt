Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Finance Bill, which includes a digital services tax. The debate covers the arguments for and against the tax, its impact on the economy, and the need for transparency and fairness.

For - Voting for New Clause 26 means supporting a review of the digital services tax within six months and an assessment of its effect on tax revenues[1]. It also means calling for international co-operation and a multilateral agreement on digital taxation.

Against - Voting against New Clause 26 means rejecting the need for a review of the digital services tax and trusting the Government's estimate of its revenue. It also means accepting the Government's unilateral approach and resisting pressure from other countries.

Decision - Voting for New Clause 26 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies that the digital services tax is not sufficient or effective enough to raise revenue and support public spending. It also suggests that the UK should align with other countries that have more ambitious digital taxation policies.

Sentiment - A
