Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, which aims to promote economic growth and development in the UK. The debate covers various aspects of the bill, such as planning, infrastructure, broadband and housing.

For - Voting for amendment 42 means opposing clause 1 of the bill, which would allow the Secretary of State to designate local authorities as failing in planning and take over their decision-making powers. The amendment argues that clause 1 is anti-localist, centralising and unnecessary.

Against - Voting against amendment 42 means supporting clause 1 of the bill, which would enable the Secretary of State to intervene in planning matters where local authorities are underperforming or delaying development. The clause is intended to speed up the planning process and boost economic growth.

Decision - Voting for amendment 42 is associated with austerity and regulation, as it implies a preference for maintaining local control and scrutiny over planning decisions, rather than allowing central government to override local democracy and impose development without adequate infrastructure or consultation.

Sentiment - B
