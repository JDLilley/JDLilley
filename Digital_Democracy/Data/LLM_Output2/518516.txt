Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Housing and Planning Bill, which aims to extend the right to buy to housing association tenants and force councils to sell high-value properties[1]. The debate focuses on Lords amendment 47E, which would require one-for-one replacement of sold council homes.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the Government's motion to disagree with Lords amendment 47E[2][3]. It means rejecting the requirement for one-for-one replacement of council homes and trusting the Government's manifesto commitment to fund both replacement and right to buy discounts[4].

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the Government's motion to disagree with Lords amendment 47E[3][2]. It means supporting the requirement for one-for-one replacement of council homes and ensuring that local authorities have adequate funding and flexibility to meet local housing needs.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with cutting spending on, and provision of, welfare and social housing. It would result in a loss of genuinely affordable homes for low-income households and a reduction in the social housing stock[5]. It would also transfer public assets to private hands and increase the housing benefit bill.

Sentiment - B
