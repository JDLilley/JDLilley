Here is my response:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on a Bill that ends free movement of EU citizens and introduces a new immigration system. The debate covers several amendments proposed by the House of Lords on various aspects of immigration policy.

For - The MPs who voted for (Ayes) in the division to disagree with Lords amendment 5 argued that physical proof of status for EU citizens under the settlement scheme was unnecessary, costly and inconsistent with the digital system used for other migrants.

Against - The MPs who voted against (Noes) in the division to disagree with Lords amendment 5 argued that physical proof of status for EU citizens under the settlement scheme was essential, fair and reassuring for those who might face discrimination or difficulties in proving their rights.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 5 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would make it harder for EU citizens to demonstrate their lawful status in the UK and potentially expose them to more hostile environment measures.

Sentiment - A
