Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Immigration Bill, which aims to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live and work in the UK, and to streamline the removal and appeal processes.

For - The supporters of the Bill argue that it is necessary to protect the public interest, national security and the integrity of the immigration system. They claim that the Bill will reduce abuse, fraud and sham marriages, and will attract the brightest and best migrants.

Against - The opponents of the Bill criticise it for being unfair, ineffective and inhumane. They contend that the Bill will undermine human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law. They warn that the Bill will create a hostile environment for migrants and ethnic minorities, and will damage the UK's reputation and economy.

Decision - The Bill will tighten immigration and borders, as it will make it more difficult for people to enter, stay and work in the UK without proper authorisation. It will also increase the powers of the Home Secretary to deport foreign criminals and to deprive naturalised citizens of their citizenship.

Sentiment - A
