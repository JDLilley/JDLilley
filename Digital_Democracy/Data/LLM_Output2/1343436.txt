Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which covers various aspects of criminal justice and public order. The debate covers different topics, such as sexual harassment, protest rights, key workers protection, and sex offenders management.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on New Clause 98 means supporting the creation of a new offence of assaulting or threatening a retail worker. This would provide extra protection for shop workers who face violence and abuse in their work, especially during the pandemic.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on New Clause 98 means opposing the creation of a new offence of assaulting or threatening a retail worker. This would maintain the existing laws that cover such offences, without creating a specific category for retail workers. Some may argue that this would avoid creating a hierarchy of victims or complicating the law.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on New Clause 98 is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because it would create a new criminal offence with higher penalties for those who attack or threaten retail workers, and it would give the police more authority to enforce it.

Sentiment - A
