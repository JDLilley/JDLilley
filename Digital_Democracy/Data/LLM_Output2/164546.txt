Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill, which covers various issues related to the economy, employment and business regulation. The debate focuses on amendments related to the national minimum wage and zero-hours contracts.

For - Voting for amendment 10 means supporting the right of zero-hours workers to receive financial compensation, tribunal powers and fixed hours contracts after a certain period of employment. This would protect workers from exploitation and insecurity, and promote fair pay and conditions.

Against - Voting against amendment 10 means opposing the regulation of zero-hours contracts and the imposition of additional costs and obligations on employers. This would preserve the flexibility and competitiveness of the labour market, and allow employers and workers to agree on the terms of their contracts.

Decision - Voting for amendment 10 is associated with regulation rather than stimulus or austerity. It aims to improve the rights and standards of workers on zero-hours contracts, rather than to stimulate or restrain the overall economy. It would impose more rules and responsibilities on employers, rather than free them from constraints.

Sentiment - B
