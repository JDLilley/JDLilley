Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file contains a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which aims to transfer EU law into UK law after Brexit. The debate focuses on the implications of the Bill for the devolution settlements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on Amendment 72 means supporting the view that the Bill should not come into effect until the devolved legislatures approve the provisions that restrict their competence to modify retained EU law.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on Amendment 72 means opposing the view that the Bill should not come into effect until the devolved legislatures approve the provisions that restrict their competence to modify retained EU law.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on Amendment 72 is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other foreign affairs, because it implies respecting the devolution settlements and seeking a consensus with the devolved Administrations on how to manage common frameworks and standards after Brexit.

Sentiment - A
