Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Trade Bill, which aims to ensure continuity of trade agreements after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs to enhance scrutiny and consultation on trade policy.

For - Voting for New Clause 20 means supporting the right of the devolved legislatures to approve the negotiating mandates for trade agreements that affect their competences or interests. It also creates a joint ministerial committee to foster co-operation between the UK Government and the devolved administrations.

Against - Voting against New Clause 20 means rejecting the need for devolved consent and scrutiny on trade negotiations. It also implies that the UK Government should have the final say on trade policy without being constrained by the views of the devolved authorities.

Decision - Voting for New Clause 20 is associated with more regulation and decentralisation of trade policy, as it gives more power and influence to the devolved legislatures. It also reflects a preference for a more collaborative and consultative approach to trade negotiations.

Sentiment - B
