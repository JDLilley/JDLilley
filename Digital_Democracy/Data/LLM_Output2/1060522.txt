Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Securitisation Regulations 2018, which implement EU rules on securitisation of loans and debts. The Labour party moved a motion to revoke the regulations, arguing that they are inadequate, opaque and unconstitutional. The Government defended the regulations as necessary, transparent and consistent with international standards.

For - Voting for the motion to revoke the regulations means opposing the Government's approach to securitisation and supporting more scrutiny and debate on the issue. It also means challenging the use of delegated legislation to amend primary legislation and criminal offences, and questioning the powers and resources of the FCA and the PRA.

Against - Voting against the motion to revoke the regulations means supporting the Government's approach to securitisation and accepting the EU rules as effective and enforceable in the UK. It also means trusting the use of delegated legislation to implement EU law and giving the FCA and the PRA the necessary powers and resources to supervise the market.

Decision - Voting for the motion to revoke the regulations is associated with austerity and regulation, as it implies a preference for more stringent rules on securitisation, more oversight by Parliament and more accountability by regulators. It also reflects a scepticism towards securitisation as a source of funding and growth for the economy.

Sentiment - B
