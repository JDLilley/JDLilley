Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Serious Crime Bill, which covers various issues related to child protection, female genital mutilation, and other offences. The debate is divided into several groups of amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: That new Clause NC2 be added to the Bill. Q acc negatived, means supporting the amendment that would create an additional defence for whistleblowers who disclose information related to historic child abuse to an official investigation or inquiry. The amendment aims to protect those who expose such crimes from prosecution under the Official Secrets Act 1989.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: That new Clause NC2 be added to the Bill. Q acc negatived, means opposing the amendment that would create an additional defence for whistleblowers who disclose information related to historic child abuse to an official investigation or inquiry. The amendment could undermine the existing safeguards and exceptions in the Official Secrets Act 1989, and potentially jeopardise national security and public interest.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: That new Clause NC2 be added to the Bill. Q acc negatived, is associated with freedom & autonomy, limiting police powers & softer punishments, limiting Crime & Justice. This is because the amendment would grant more leeway and protection to whistleblowers who reveal information that could be classified as secret or sensitive by the authorities, and reduce the risk of criminal sanctions for doing so.

Sentiment - B
