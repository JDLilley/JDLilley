Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, which aims to establish a new customs regime for the UK after leaving the EU. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Report Stage Amdt 21 means supporting a new clause that establishes a negotiating objective to maintain the UK's participation in the EU Customs Union, and provides for Parts 1 and 2 of the Act to expire if that objective is met[1][2]. This would avoid tariffs, quotas, and border checks on trade with the EU.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Report Stage Amdt 21 means opposing a new clause that establishes a negotiating objective to maintain the UK's participation in the EU Customs Union, and provides for Parts 1 and 2 of the Act to expire if that objective is met[1][2]. This would allow the UK to set its own tariffs, quotas, and trade policies with other countries outside the EU.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Report Stage Amdt 21 is associated with greater spending on, and provision of, Welfare & Social Housing. This is because staying in the EU Customs Union would preserve the UK's access to the EU Single Market, which supports economic growth, employment, and public services. Leaving the EU Customs Union would expose the UK to trade barriers, lower income, and higher costs, which would reduce the resources available for Welfare & Social Housing.

Sentiment - A
