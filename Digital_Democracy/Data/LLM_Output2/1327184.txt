Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Finance Bill, which contains various amendments and new clauses related to corporation tax, investment and tax avoidance. The debate covers different perspectives on the impact of the Bill on the UK economy and public services.

For - Voting for New Clause 23 means supporting a review of the impact of a global minimum rate of corporation tax on the UK's tax revenues and tax gap[1]. It also means backing President Biden's plans for international tax reform and ending the race to the bottom by tax havens.

Against - Voting against New Clause 23 means opposing a review of the impact of a global minimum rate of corporation tax on the UK's tax revenues and tax gap[1]. It also means rejecting President Biden's plans for international tax reform and preserving the UK's fiscal sovereignty and flexibility.

Decision - Voting for New Clause 23 is associated with stimulus and regulation, because it implies that the UK should raise more revenue from multinational corporations that avoid tax, and that it should co-operate with other countries to harmonise tax rules and prevent profit shifting.

Sentiment - B
