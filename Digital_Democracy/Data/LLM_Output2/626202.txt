Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Investigatory Powers Bill, which aims to regulate the use of surveillance and data collection by law enforcement and security agencies. The debate focuses on the Lords amendments, especially amendment 15, which relates to press regulation and phone hacking.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means rejecting amendment 15 and supporting the Government's position. It means defending the freedom and independence of the press from costly litigation and interference. It means prioritising the security and safety of the nation over the regulation of the media.

Against - Voting 'Noes' means accepting amendment 15 and opposing the Government's position. It means implementing the recommendations of the Leveson inquiry and protecting the victims of press intrusion and phone hacking. It means holding the press accountable for their actions and ensuring a fair and balanced system of self-regulation.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, strengthening Crime & Justice. It implies that the Investigatory Powers Bill is necessary and justified to combat serious crimes and threats, and that the press should not be subject to additional sanctions or incentives to join a recognised regulator.

Sentiment - A
