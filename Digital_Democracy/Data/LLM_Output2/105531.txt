Hello, this is Bing. I have reviewed the text file open in your current webpage and I will try to answer your questions as best as I can.

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill that proposes to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union by 2017. The debate covers various amendments that suggest different dates, conditions and questions for the referendum.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the amendment proposed by Mr Bain, which would require the Secretary of State to consult various organisations on the merits or otherwise of the UK remaining a member of the EU and to report to Parliament before setting a date for the referendum.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the amendment proposed by Mr Bain, which would delay the referendum and add an extra layer of consultation. It also means supporting the original bill, which sets a deadline of 31 December 2017 for holding the referendum.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other foreign affairs, because it implies that the UK should seek the views and interests of various stakeholders before making a decision on its EU membership. It also suggests that the UK should not rush into a referendum without considering the consequences and benefits of staying or leaving.

Sentiment - A
