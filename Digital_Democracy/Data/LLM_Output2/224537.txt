Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on a bill that would allow the House of Lords to expel or suspend its members for misconduct. The bill was introduced by Baroness Hayman and Sir George Young as a private member's bill.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting amendment 1, which would require the Lord Speaker to report on the compliance of any investigation with natural justice and human rights before the House of Lords agrees to expel or suspend a member.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing amendment 1, which would add an extra layer of scrutiny and delay to the expulsion or suspension process. It could also undermine the exclusive cognisance of the House of Lords over its own affairs.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is not directly associated with either greater or lesser spending on and provision of welfare and social housing. It is more related to the principles of fairness and accountability in the disciplinary procedures of the House of Lords.

Sentiment - C
