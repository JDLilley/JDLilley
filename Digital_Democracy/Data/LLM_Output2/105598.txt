Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Immigration Bill, which aims to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live and work in the UK, and to streamline the removal and appeal processes. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by the government and the opposition.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means supporting the government's decision to remove clause 11 from the Bill, which would have abolished the right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for most immigration decisions. The government argues that this would reduce costs, delays and abuse of the system, and that other remedies are available.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means opposing the government's decision to remove clause 11 from the Bill, which would have abolished the right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for most immigration decisions. The opposition argues that this would deny access to justice, increase judicial reviews and human rights claims, and undermine the rule of law and fairness.

Decision - The division on clause 11 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would make it more difficult for immigrants to challenge adverse decisions affecting their status and rights in the UK. It would also reduce the scope of independent scrutiny and oversight of the Home Office's actions.

Sentiment - A
