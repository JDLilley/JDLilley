Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file contains a debate on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which aims to transfer EU law into UK law after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs to modify or limit the Bill.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Amendment 2 means supporting a change to clause 7 of the Bill, which gives ministers the power to correct deficiencies in retained EU law. The amendment would limit the scope of this power and provide a scheme for interpretation as a backstop.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Amendment 2 means opposing the change to clause 7 of the Bill, and keeping the original wording that gives ministers more flexibility and discretion to deal with deficiencies in retained EU law. The amendment would restrict this power and create uncertainty.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Amendment 2 is associated with globalisation and strengthening ties with the European Union and other Foreign Affairs, because it would ensure that UK law remains aligned with EU law as much as possible, and that any changes are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and oversight.

Sentiment - A
