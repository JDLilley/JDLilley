Summary - The text file is a record of the parliamentary proceedings on various bills and motions, including the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, which aims to promote economic growth and development. The debate covers different aspects of the bill, such as planning, infrastructure, broadband, and local representation.

For - Voting for amendment 59 means supporting the proposal to remove clause 1 and schedule 1 from the bill, which would allow the Secretary of State to designate local authorities as failing in planning and take over their decision-making powers. The amendment argues that this is anti-localist, centralising, and undemocratic.

Against - Voting against amendment 59 means opposing the proposal to remove clause 1 and schedule 1 from the bill, which would allow the Secretary of State to designate local authorities as failing in planning and take over their decision-making powers. The amendment argues that this is necessary to ensure sufficient housing and other development in a sustainable manner.

Decision - Voting for amendment 59 is associated with austerity and regulation, as it implies a preference for limiting the central government's intervention in local planning matters and preserving the existing system of checks and balances.

Sentiment - B
