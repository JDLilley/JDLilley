Thank you for your request. Here is my response:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a Bill that ends free movement of EU citizens and introduces a new immigration system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords.

For - The Government argues that Lords amendment 3, which grants settled status to children in care and care leavers who are EU citizens, is unnecessary and that they are already providing support and guidance to local authorities to help them apply to the EU settlement scheme[1][2].

Against - The Opposition argues that Lords amendment 3 is essential to protect the rights of vulnerable children and young people who may be left behind or undocumented after the end of free movement[3]. They cite evidence of low application rates and lack of awareness among local authorities.

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 3 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would remove a safeguard for a specific group of EU citizens who may face difficulties in obtaining lawful status in the UK.

Sentiment - A
