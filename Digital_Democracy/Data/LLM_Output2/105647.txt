Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a tax relief for married couples and civil partners. The debate covers the arguments for and against the policy, its impact on different groups, and its cost and complexity.

For - Voting for the amendment means supporting a review of the tax relief to assess its effectiveness, fairness, and alternatives. It also means challenging the Government's record on supporting families, women, and low-income households.

Against - Voting against the amendment means rejecting a review of the tax relief and defending the Government's policy as a recognition of marriage in the tax system. It also means endorsing the Government's economic strategy and its impact on growth, deficit reduction, and child poverty.

Decision - Voting for the amendment is not clearly associated with either stimulus & the free market or austerity & regulation. It could be seen as a demand for more evidence-based policymaking and more progressive taxation, or as a criticism of the Government's priorities and competence.

Sentiment - C
