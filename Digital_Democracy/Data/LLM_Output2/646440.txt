Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Digital Economy Bill, which aims to connect, support and protect the digital economy and its users. The debate covers various topics such as child protection, online media, and telecoms[1].

For - Voting for New Clause 8 means supporting the introduction of a broadband connection voucher scheme to allow users to access broadband other than that supplied by the universal service provider[2]. This would give users more choice and flexibility in their broadband service.
