Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the asylum and immigration system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 5 means supporting the Government's view that the Bill is compatible with the 1951 refugee convention and the 1967 protocol, and that there is no need to state that explicitly on the face of the Bill[1].

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 5 means supporting the Lords' view that the Bill should include a clause specifying that nothing in it authorises any policies or decisions that are incompatible with the 1951 refugee convention and the 1967 protocol, as a safeguard for refugees' rights.

Decision - The Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 5 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would remove a potential legal challenge to the Government's policies and decisions on asylum and immigration, which have been criticised by some as being in breach of international law and humanitarian standards.

Sentiment - A
