For - Voting for New Clause 27 means supporting a review of the residential property developer tax at different rates, to assess how much revenue it would raise. The clause is proposed by the Opposition to ensure that the tax is fair and effective.

Against - Voting against New Clause 27 means rejecting the need for a review of the residential property developer tax at different rates. The Government argues that the tax is already set at an appropriate level and that a review would be unnecessary and burdensome.
