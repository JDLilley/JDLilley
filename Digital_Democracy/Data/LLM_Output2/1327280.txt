Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Finance Bill, which contains various tax measures. The debate focuses on amendments and new clauses proposed by different parties, especially on the issues of global minimum corporate tax rate, super deduction, and tax reliefs.

For - Voting for New Clause 9 means supporting the Government's plan to introduce a super deduction for capital investment by companies, which is intended to boost business spending and economic recovery. It also means rejecting the Opposition's amendments that would impose conditions or restrictions on the super deduction.

Against - Voting against New Clause 9 means opposing the Government's plan to introduce a super deduction for capital investment by companies, which is seen as a costly and ineffective tax break that mainly benefits large multinationals and tech giants. It also means supporting the Opposition's amendments that would limit the super deduction to certain companies or sectors, or require additional reporting or disclosure.

Decision - Voting for New Clause 9 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it aims to stimulate business investment by reducing the tax burden on companies and allowing them to decide how to allocate their resources. It also rejects any interference or regulation by the Government or other bodies on the eligibility or accountability of the super deduction.

Sentiment - A
