Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which aims to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the EU. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on Lords amendment 37 motion to disagree means supporting the Government's position that the delegated powers in the Bill should be used only when it is appropriate, not necessary, to correct deficiencies in retained EU law[1]. This would give Ministers more flexibility and avoid legal challenges.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on Lords amendment 37 motion to disagree means supporting the Lords' position that the delegated powers in the Bill should be used only when it is necessary, not appropriate, to correct deficiencies in retained EU law. This would limit Ministers' discretion and ensure parliamentary scrutiny.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on Lords amendment 37 motion to disagree is associated with protectionism and independence from the European Union and other Foreign Affairs, because it would allow the Government to make more changes to retained EU law without consulting Parliament or other stakeholders.

Sentiment - B
