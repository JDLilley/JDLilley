Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the UK's immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: New Clause 8 means supporting the reduction or abolition of fees for children registering as British citizens, especially those who are looked after by local authorities or cannot afford the fees. The supporters argue that this is a matter of fairness, human rights and inclusion.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: New Clause 8 means opposing the change in fees for children registering as British citizens, and maintaining the current system that charges Â£1,012 per child. The opponents argue that this is a matter of fiscal responsibility, cost recovery and deterrence of abuse.

Decision - The New Clause 8 would soften immigration and borders, as it would make it easier and cheaper for children who are born or live in the UK to acquire British citizenship, regardless of their parents' immigration status or financial situation. It would also remove a barrier that prevents some children from accessing their rights and services as British citizens.

Sentiment - B
