Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the asylum and immigration system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 7 means supporting the Government's policy of restricting the right to work for asylum seekers to those who have waited 12 months for a decision and only for jobs on the shortage occupation list[1]. The Government argues that this policy prevents abuse of the system and discourages illegal entry.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 7 means opposing the Government's policy and favouring a more generous approach to allowing asylum seekers to work. The opponents argue that this policy would benefit the economy, society and the mental health of asylum seekers, as well as being in line with international standards.

Decision - The Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 7 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would make it harder for asylum seekers to access the labour market and integrate into the UK society. It would also signal a less welcoming attitude towards those seeking protection in the UK.

Sentiment - A
