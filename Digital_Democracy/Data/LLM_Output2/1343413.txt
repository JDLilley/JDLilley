Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which covers various aspects of criminal justice. The debate covers different stages, amendments and opinions on the bill.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on Amendment 8 means supporting the government's proposal to increase the maximum penalty for criminal damage to a memorial from three months to 10 years imprisonment. This is intended to deter vandalism and protect the nation's heritage.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on Amendment 8 means opposing the government's proposal and arguing that it is disproportionate and unnecessary. This is based on the view that criminal damage to a memorial is already an offence and that the existing sentencing guidelines are sufficient.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on Amendment 8 is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because it gives the police more authority to arrest and charge offenders who damage memorials, and it imposes a higher deterrent and retributive effect on such offenders.

Sentiment - A
