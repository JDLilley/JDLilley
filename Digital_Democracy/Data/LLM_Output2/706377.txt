Summary - The text file is a record of a vote in the UK Parliament on a motion to relocate unaccompanied refugee children from Greece and Italy to the UK. The motion was agreed by 254 votes to 1.

For - The supporters of the motion argued that the UK had a moral duty to help vulnerable children who were at risk of exploitation, trafficking and abuse in overcrowded camps. They also cited the UK's historical role in accepting refugees and the benefits of diversity.

Against - The only opponent of the motion was Philip Hollobone, a Conservative MP, who claimed that the UK had already done enough to assist refugees and that the motion would encourage more people to make dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean.

Decision - The motion to relocate unaccompanied children in Greece and Italy would soften immigration and borders, as it would allow more refugees to enter the UK and grant them legal status and protection.

Sentiment - B
