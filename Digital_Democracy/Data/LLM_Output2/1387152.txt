Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Subsidy Control Bill, which sets out the rules for granting subsidies in the UK after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different parties, mainly concerning agriculture, environment, transparency, devolution and review mechanisms.

For - Voting for Amendment 19 means supporting the requirement for the Secretary of State to seek the consent of the devolved administrations before making regulations under clause 11, which allows for exemptions from subsidy control requirements[1]. This would enhance the role and autonomy of the devolved administrations in subsidy policy.

Against - Voting against Amendment 19 means opposing the requirement for the Secretary of State to seek the consent of the devolved administrations before making regulations under clause 11[1]. This would preserve the power and discretion of the Secretary of State to make exemptions from subsidy control requirements without needing consent from other authorities.

Decision - Voting for Amendment 19 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it would allow the devolved administrations to have more say and flexibility in granting subsidies that suit their specific needs and circumstances, without being constrained by uniform rules or regulations imposed by the Secretary of State.

Sentiment - A
