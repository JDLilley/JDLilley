Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Financial Services Bill, which aims to regulate the financial sector after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments made by the House of Lords, such as duty of care, mortgage prisoners, and climate change.

For - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 8 means rejecting the proposal to cap the interest rates and offer new deals to mortgage prisoners, who are stuck with high-cost loans from inactive lenders. The Government argues that this is an unprecedented and disproportionate intervention that could harm financial stability and fairness.

Against - Voting against the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 8 means supporting the proposal to help mortgage prisoners, who are paying thousands of pounds more than other borrowers and have no access to competitive rates. The Opposition argues that this is a matter of justice and compassion for those who have suffered for 13 years.

Decision - Voting for the motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 8 is associated with austerity and regulation, because it implies that the Government is unwilling to spend public money or interfere with the market to assist mortgage prisoners, and that it prefers to maintain strict prudential standards and risk appetite for lenders.

Sentiment - B
