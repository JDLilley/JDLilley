Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Bank of England and Financial Services Bill, which aims to reform the governance and accountability of the Bank and the Financial Conduct Authority.

For - Voting for the Bill means supporting the Government's proposals to enhance the role of the Treasury Committee in scrutinising the FCA chief executive, to reduce the frequency of MPC meetings, and to protect sensitive information held by the Bank.

Against - Voting against the Bill means opposing the Government's proposals and favouring alternative amendments that seek to change the name and composition of the Bank, to give the MPC a dual mandate of inflation and employment, and to increase transparency and devolution.

Decision - Voting for the Bill is associated with austerity and regulation, as it maintains the primacy of price stability over other objectives, and it limits the disclosure of information that could affect financial stability or market confidence.

Sentiment - B
