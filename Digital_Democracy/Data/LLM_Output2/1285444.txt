Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Trade Bill, which covers issues such as parliamentary scrutiny, standards and human rights in trade agreements. The debate focuses on the amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for the Government's motion means rejecting the Lords amendments that would give Parliament more power to scrutinise and approve trade deals, especially with countries accused of genocide or violating standards. It also means supporting the Government's alternative amendments that would limit the role of the courts and Select Committees in determining genocide and safeguarding standards.

Against - Voting against the Government's motion means supporting the Lords amendments that would require the Government to seek parliamentary consent for trade deals, and to suspend trade negotiations with countries where there is credible evidence of genocide. It also means opposing the Government's alternative amendments that would weaken parliamentary and judicial oversight of trade policy and human rights.

Decision - Voting for the Government's motion is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it would give the Government more flexibility and autonomy to pursue trade deals with a wide range of partners, without being constrained by parliamentary or judicial scrutiny. It would also prioritise economic interests over human rights and standards concerns.

Sentiment - A
