Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the UK's asylum and immigration system. The debate covers various aspects of the Bill, such as its impact on human rights, legal routes, public services, and international obligations.

For - The MPs who voted for Keir Starmer's Reasoned Amendment to Second Reading argued that the Bill breaches the 1951 Refugee Convention, does not address the Government's failure to process asylum applications competently, fails to deal with the criminal gangs who exploit migrants, fails to replace the Dublin III regulations, fails to re-establish safe routes and help unaccompanied child refugees, and fails to deliver a workable agreement with France to address the issue of boat crossings.

Against - The MPs who voted against Keir Starmer's Reasoned Amendment to Second Reading argued that the Bill is necessary to address the growing problem of illegal entry into the UK by migrants crossing the Dover straits. They argued that the Bill will make the asylum system more firm but fair, by introducing new penalties for illegal entry and people smugglers, creating new one-stop processes for claims and appeals, and establishing new safe and legal routes for refugees. They also argued that the Bill will protect the UK's sovereignty, security, and public services.

Decision - The Keir Starmer's Reasoned Amendment to Second Reading would have softened immigration and borders, by rejecting the Bill and calling for a more humane and effective approach to asylum and immigration policy. The amendment would have challenged the Government's plans to create a two-tier system of protection based on how people arrive in the UK, to offshore asylum processing in third countries, and to criminalise asylum seekers who enter illegally[1].

Sentiment - B
