Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Financial Services Bill, which aims to regulate the financial sector after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for new clause 7 means supporting the regulation of buy-now-pay-later credit services and other lending services that have non-interest-bearing elements[2]. This would protect consumers from unaffordable debt and bring these services under the FCA's oversight.

Against - Voting against new clause 7 means opposing the regulation of buy-now-pay-later credit services and other lending services that have non-interest-bearing elements[1][2]. This would allow these services to operate without FCA's supervision and avoid additional costs and burdens for the industry.

Decision - Voting for new clause 7 is associated with austerity and regulation, as it would impose more rules and restrictions on the financial sector and limit consumer choice and access to credit.

Sentiment - B
