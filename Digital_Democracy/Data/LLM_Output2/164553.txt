Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill, which aims to support small businesses and regulate pub companies. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - Voting for the new clause 2 means supporting the market rent only option for tenants of large pub-owning businesses, which would allow them to pay an independent market rent and not be bound by the beer tie[1]. This is seen as a way to protect tenants from unfair practices and increase competition.

Against - Voting against the new clause 2 means opposing the market rent only option and preferring the parallel rent assessment proposed by the Government, which would enable tenants to compare the tied deal with a free-of-tie option. This is seen as a way to preserve the beer tie model and avoid unintended consequences for the sector.

Decision - Voting for the new clause 2 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it would give tenants more freedom and choice in their business operations and encourage more diversity and innovation in the pub industry.

Sentiment - A
