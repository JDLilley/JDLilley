Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to disagree with LA 7B means supporting the Government's position that asylum seekers and their adult dependants should not have the right to work in six months, but in 12 months, and only in jobs on the shortage occupation list[1]. This is to prevent undermining the economic migration scheme and encouraging channel crossings[2].

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to disagree with LA 7B means supporting the Lords' amendment that asylum seekers and their adult dependants should have the right to work in six months, regardless of the shortage occupation list. This is to allow them to contribute to society, integrate better and improve their mental health.

Decision - The Motion to disagree with LA 7B would tighten immigration and borders, as it would restrict the access of asylum seekers and their adult dependants to the labour market and discourage them from coming to the UK.

Sentiment - A
