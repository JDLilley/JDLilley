Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the UK's immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Third Reading means supporting the Government's bill, which claims to make the system fairer, firmer and more efficient. The bill introduces new measures to deter illegal entry, streamline asylum claims, remove failed asylum seekers and protect vulnerable people.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Third Reading means opposing the Government's bill, which is criticised as cruel, inhumane and unlawful. The bill undermines the right to seek asylum, creates a two-tier system based on how people arrive, criminalises refugees and reduces judicial oversight.

Decision - The Third Reading of the bill would tighten immigration and borders, as it would make it harder for people to enter and stay in the UK legally, especially if they use irregular routes. It would also increase the powers of the Home Secretary and the Border Force to enforce immigration rules.

Sentiment - A
