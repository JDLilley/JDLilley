Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on various clauses of the Finance (No. 2) Bill, which covers tax changes and business support measures. The debate focuses on the fairness, simplicity and competitiveness of the tax system and its impact on different sectors and regions.

For - Voting for clause 6 means supporting the Government's decision to cut the rate of the banking surcharge from 8% to 3% and raise its allowance from £25 million to £100 million[1]. The Government argues that this will make the UK banking sector more internationally competitive and protect jobs and tax revenues[3].

Against - Voting against clause 6 means opposing the Government's decision to cut the rate of the banking surcharge and raise its allowance[2]. The Opposition argues that this will reduce the contribution of banks to public finances, which is justified by their implicit state guarantee and the costs of the financial crisis.

Decision - Voting for clause 6 is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it reduces the tax burden on banks and encourages them to invest and grow in a global market. Voting for clause 6 implies a belief that lower taxes will boost economic activity and generate more revenue in the long run.

Sentiment - A
