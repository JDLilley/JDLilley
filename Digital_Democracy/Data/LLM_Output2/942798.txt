Thank you for your request. Here is my response:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Trade Bill, which aims to ensure continuity of trade agreements after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties and perspectives.

For - Voting for amendment 25 means supporting the inclusion of human rights and democracy clauses in trade agreements, and allowing Parliament to revoke such agreements if those clauses are breached by the other party.

Against - Voting against amendment 25 means opposing the addition of human rights and democracy clauses in trade agreements, and leaving the decision to revoke such agreements to the Government's discretion.

Decision - Voting for amendment 25 is associated with regulation, as it imposes conditions and restrictions on trade agreements based on human rights and democracy standards. Voting against amendment 25 is associated with the free market, as it allows trade agreements to be made and maintained without such conditions and restrictions.

Sentiment - B
