Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which aims to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the EU. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on Lords amendment 128 means supporting the Government's proposal to reject the amendment, which would give a parliamentary committee the power to make binding recommendations on how to use the delegated powers in the Bill. The Government argues that this would undermine its flexibility and efficiency in correcting the statute book.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on Lords amendment 128 means supporting the Lords' proposal to keep the amendment, which would enhance parliamentary scrutiny and accountability over the use of the delegated powers in the Bill. The Lords argue that this would prevent Ministers from making inappropriate or unnecessary changes to retained EU law.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on Lords amendment 128 is associated with protectionism and independence from the European Union and other Foreign Affairs, because it would allow the Government to exercise more control over the domestic legal system without being constrained by parliamentary oversight or international obligations.

Sentiment - B
