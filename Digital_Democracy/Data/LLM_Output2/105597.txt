Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Immigration Bill, which aims to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live and work in the UK, and to streamline the removal and appeal processes. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by the government and the opposition.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means supporting the government's new clause 15, which would amend the UK Borders Act 2007 to limit the exceptions to automatic deportation of foreign criminals[1]. The clause would restrict the human rights grounds for avoiding deportation to only cases involving rights under Articles 2 or 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protect the right to life and the prohibition of torture.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means opposing the government's new clause 15, which would amend the UK Borders Act 2007 to limit the exceptions to automatic deportation of foreign criminals[1]. The clause would restrict the human rights grounds for avoiding deportation to only cases involving rights under Articles 2 or 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protect the right to life and the prohibition of torture. The opposition argues that this would violate other human rights, such as family life and fair trial, and that it would harm the best interests of children affected by deportation decisions.

Decision - The Consideration of the Bill, as amended in the PBC. That New Clause NC15 be added to the Bill (Question on new Clause selected for separate decision). Question accordingly negatived. would tighten immigration and borders, as it would make it easier for the government to deport foreign criminals without regard to their human rights claims, except in cases where their life or freedom from torture would be at risk.

Sentiment - A
