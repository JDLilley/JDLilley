Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Trade Bill, which aims to ensure continuity of trade agreements after Brexit. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties and perspectives.

For - Voting for the Trade Bill Third Reading means supporting the Government's approach to transitioning existing EU trade agreements into UK-only agreements, with minimal changes and parliamentary scrutiny. It also means trusting the Government's ability to negotiate new trade deals in the future.

Against - Voting against the Trade Bill Third Reading means opposing the Government's lack of transparency and consultation on trade policy, and demanding more involvement of Parliament, devolved authorities, businesses, trade unions and civil society in shaping and scrutinising trade agreements. It also means challenging the Government's potential use of Henry VIII powers to amend legislation without proper oversight.

Decision - Voting for the Trade Bill Third Reading is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies a preference for maintaining the status quo of existing trade agreements and pursuing new ones with minimal regulatory barriers and democratic accountability. It also suggests a confidence in the Government's ability to secure favourable terms for UK trade in a post-Brexit environment.

Sentiment - A
