Thank you for your request. I have reviewed the text file open in your current webpage and here is my response:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, which aims to establish a new customs regime for the UK after leaving the EU. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs, reflecting their views on the best way to manage trade relations with the EU and other countries.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Report Stage New Clause 36 means supporting the proposal to establish a negotiating objective to secure the UK's participation in a customs union with the EU, and to provide for Parts 1 and 2 of the Act to expire if that objective is met[1]. The supporters of this proposal argue that it would protect jobs, businesses, and the economy from the negative effects of leaving the EU Customs Union, and that it would avoid creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Report Stage New Clause 36 means opposing the proposal to establish a negotiating objective to secure the UK's participation in a customs union with the EU, and to provide for Parts 1 and 2 of the Act to expire if that objective is met[2]. The opponents of this proposal argue that it would limit the UK's ability to strike independent trade deals with other countries, and that it would undermine the result of the referendum that voted to leave the EU.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Report Stage New Clause 36 is associated with greater spending on, and provision of, Welfare & Social Housing. This is because staying in a customs union with the EU would maintain the current level of trade and economic activity, which would generate more tax revenue for the government to spend on public services. It would also reduce the risk of disruption and hardship for low-income households that depend on welfare benefits and social housing.

Sentiment - A
