Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which covers various aspects of law and order in the UK. The debate covers topics such as protest rights, sexual harassment, abortion, and violence reduction.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on New Clause 19 means supporting the creation of a new offence of assaulting or threatening a retail worker who is enforcing the law on age-restricted sales. This would protect shop workers from abuse and violence when they are doing their job.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on New Clause 19 means opposing the creation of a new offence of assaulting or threatening a retail worker who is enforcing the law on age-restricted sales. This would avoid creating a hierarchy of victims and maintain consistency with existing laws that cover assaults and threats against any person.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on New Clause 19 is associated with greater police powers, harsher punishments, and strengthening Crime & Justice. This is because it would create a specific offence with a higher maximum penalty for attacking or threatening retail workers, and it would give the police more authority to arrest and prosecute offenders.

Sentiment - A
