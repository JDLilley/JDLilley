Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Energy Bill, which aims to regulate the onshore wind industry and reduce subsidies for renewable energy. The debate covers various aspects of the bill, such as the closure of the renewables obligation, the grace periods for existing projects, and the impact of wind turbines on noise and health.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on New Clause 3 means supporting the Scottish National Party's proposal to devolve the power to close the renewables obligation for onshore wind in Scotland to the Scottish Ministers[1]. The SNP argues that this would respect the local decisions and preferences of Scotland, which has a different energy mix and policy from the rest of the UK.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on New Clause 3 means opposing the SNP's proposal and maintaining the UK Government's authority to close the renewables obligation for onshore wind in Scotland. The Government argues that this would ensure a consistent and coherent approach to energy policy across the UK, and avoid imposing additional costs on consumers and taxpayers.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on New Clause 3 is associated with prioritising environmental sustainability in the context of Environment & Energy, because it would allow Scotland to continue supporting onshore wind, which is one of the cheapest and most abundant forms of renewable energy. It would also reflect Scotland's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change.

Sentiment - A
