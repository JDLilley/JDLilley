Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on a Bill that ends free movement of EU citizens and introduces a new immigration system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords on issues such as social care, family reunion, detention and modern slavery.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to Disagree with Lords Amendment 6 means supporting the Government's position that imposing a 28-day time limit on immigration detention is not practical and would encourage abuse of the system. The Government argues that detention is used as a last resort and is subject to judicial oversight.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to Disagree with Lords Amendment 6 means supporting the Lords' proposal that there should be a maximum length of 28 days for holding someone in immigration detention. The Lords argue that indefinite detention is a violation of human rights and causes unnecessary suffering and waste of resources[1].

Decision - The Motion to Disagree with Lords Amendment 6 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would maintain the Government's power to detain people for longer than 28 days without a clear end date. This could deter or prevent some people from seeking asylum or protection in the UK.

Sentiment - A
