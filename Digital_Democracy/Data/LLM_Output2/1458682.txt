Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK House of Commons on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - The Government and its supporters argue that voting for the motion to disagree with LA 8B is necessary to deter illegal and dangerous journeys to the UK, to combat people smuggling, and to align with the first safe country principle. They claim that the UK has other safe and legal routes for refugees.

Against - The Opposition and some Conservative rebels argue that voting against the motion to disagree with LA 8B is essential to uphold the UK's obligations under the 1951 refugee convention, to respect the right to seek asylum in any country, and to avoid creating a two-tier system based on mode of arrival. They criticise the lack of evidence and human rights safeguards for the Government's plan.

Decision - The motion to disagree with LA 8B would tighten immigration and borders, as it would prevent asylum seekers who have passed through a safe third country from having their claims considered in the UK, unless they have a returns agreement with that country. This would reduce the number of people who can access protection in the UK and increase the risk of refoulement.

Sentiment - A
