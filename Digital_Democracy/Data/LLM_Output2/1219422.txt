Hello, this is Bing. I have reviewed the text file open in your current webpage and here is my response:

Summary - The text file contains a debate on the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, which aims to end free movement of persons from the EU, EEA and Switzerland and introduce a new points-based immigration system. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs.

For - The MPs who voted for (Ayes) in the division: Third Reading supported the Bill as a way to deliver on the Brexit referendum result, take back control of the UK's borders, attract skilled workers, protect public services and security, and end unfairness and discrimination in the immigration system.

Against - The MPs who voted against (Noes) in the division: Third Reading opposed the Bill as a threat to the rights and livelihoods of millions of EU citizens living in the UK, a risk to the health and social care sectors, a source of increased bureaucracy and costs for employers and migrants, and a violation of the devolution settlements.

Decision - The Third Reading of the Bill would tighten immigration and borders, as it would end free movement of persons from the EU, EEA and Switzerland, impose stricter criteria and conditions for entry and stay, and increase immigration enforcement and data sharing.

Sentiment - A
