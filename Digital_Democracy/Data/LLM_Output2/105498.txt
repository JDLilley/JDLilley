Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill. The debate covers various topics related to crime and justice, such as forced marriage, court fees, and miscarriages of justice.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the new clause NC3, which would require the Home Secretary to publish a code of practice on the use of surveillance powers by local authorities. The supporters of the new clause argue that it would increase transparency, accountability, and public confidence in the use of surveillance powers.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the new clause NC3, which would require the Home Secretary to publish a code of practice on the use of surveillance powers by local authorities. The opponents of the new clause argue that it is unnecessary, duplicative, and burdensome, as there are already existing safeguards and oversight mechanisms for the use of surveillance powers.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with freedom and autonomy, limiting police powers and softer punishments, limiting Crime & Justice. This is because the new clause NC3 would impose more restrictions and scrutiny on the use of surveillance powers by local authorities, which could protect the privacy and civil liberties of individuals from excessive or unlawful interference.

Sentiment - B
