Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on a bill that would allow voters to recall their MPs in certain circumstances. The bill was proposed by Zac Goldsmith and supported by 127 MPs, while 17 MPs voted against it.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the bill and giving more power to the voters to hold their MPs accountable. It also means agreeing with the argument that recall is a necessary step towards a purer democracy and that it would heal the broken relationship between people and power[1].
