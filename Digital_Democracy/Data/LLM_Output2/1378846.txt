Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill, which implements the measures announced in the Budget. The debate covers the economic impact of the pandemic, the tax changes, and the social care levy.

For - Voting for Keir Starmer's amendment means rejecting the Bill and criticising the Government for raising taxes on working people, cutting taxes for banks, failing to invest in growth and public services, and breaking their promises on business rates and air passenger duty.

Against - Voting against Keir Starmer's amendment means supporting the Bill and defending the Government's actions as necessary to rebuild the economy, support businesses and individuals, strengthen public finances, and tackle the social care crisis. It also means accusing Labour of being irresponsible and unrealistic.

Decision - Voting for Keir Starmer's amendment is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it calls for more investment in jobs, skills, and infrastructure, and for a fundamental reform of business taxation that would incentivise innovation and competition.

Sentiment - A
