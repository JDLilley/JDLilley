Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which would allow the Prime Minister to trigger Article 50 and start the process of leaving the EU. The debate covers various aspects of the UK's future relationship with the EU and other countries.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Third Reading means supporting the government's plan to invoke Article 50 by the end of March 2017 and respect the outcome of the referendum. It also means accepting that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union and seek a new trade deal with the EU.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Third Reading means opposing the government's plan to invoke Article 50 without a clear strategy or guarantees on various issues, such as workers' rights, environmental standards, security cooperation, and the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU. It also means rejecting the idea that leaving the single market and the customs union is inevitable or desirable.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Third Reading is associated with protectionism and independence from the European Union and other foreign affairs. It implies that the UK wants to regain full control over its laws, borders, and trade policy, and that it is willing to sacrifice some economic benefits and political influence for that purpose. It also suggests that the UK does not trust or value its European partners enough to cooperate with them on a range of issues.

Sentiment - B
