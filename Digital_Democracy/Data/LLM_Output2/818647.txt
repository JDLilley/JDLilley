Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, which aims to prepare the UK for leaving the EU customs union and establish its own customs regime. The debate covers various aspects of the Bill, such as trade facilitation, trade remedies, VAT, and the Irish border.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division on Jeremy Corbyn's amendment means supporting the Labour party's proposal to reject the Bill and call for a new customs union with the EU that would protect jobs, living standards, and trade. It also means criticising the Government's handling of Brexit negotiations and its lack of clarity on future customs arrangements.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division on Jeremy Corbyn's amendment means opposing the Labour party's proposal and backing the Government's Bill, which would enable the UK to have an independent trade policy and negotiate new trade agreements with other countries. It also means supporting the Government's objectives of ensuring frictionless trade with the EU and avoiding a hard border in Ireland[1].

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division on Jeremy Corbyn's amendment is not directly associated with either greater or lesser spending on and provision of welfare and social housing. However, it could be argued that staying in a customs union with the EU would help to maintain economic stability and avoid disruption to public services and revenues, which could benefit welfare and social housing in the long term.

Sentiment - C
