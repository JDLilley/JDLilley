Thank you for your request. Here is my response based on the text file open in your current webpage:

Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on a bill that would require a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union. The bill was supported by most Conservative MPs and some Labour MPs, and opposed by most Labour MPs and some Liberal Democrats.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting the bill and giving the British people a choice on whether to stay in or leave the EU. It means trusting the people to decide on a fundamental issue that affects their constitutional, economic and social rights.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means opposing the bill and denying the British people a say on their relationship with the EU. It means fearing the uncertainty and instability that a referendum might cause for business, trade and diplomacy.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with protectionism and independence from the EU and other foreign affairs. It implies a desire to regain sovereignty, control borders, reduce payments and regulations, and pursue bilateral trade deals.

Sentiment - B
