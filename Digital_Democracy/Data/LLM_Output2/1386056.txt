Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the UK's immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: New Clause 3 means supporting a specific offence for trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation[1]. The supporters argue that this would acknowledge the link between human trafficking and sexual exploitation, and provide better protection and prosecution for the victims.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: New Clause 3 means opposing a specific offence for trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The opponents argue that this would create a two-tiered system based on the type of exploitation, and that the existing offence of human trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 is sufficient and comprehensive.

Decision - The New Clause 3 would soften immigration and borders, as it would provide more leniency and support for victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, regardless of their immigration status or time of disclosure[2]. It would also require the Secretary of State to issue guidance on how to identify such victims[3].

Sentiment - B
