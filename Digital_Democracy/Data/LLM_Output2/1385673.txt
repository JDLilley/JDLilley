Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the UK's immigration and asylum system. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by MPs from different parties.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: New Clause 52 means supporting the creation of a safe and legal route for asylum seekers who have family members in the UK. This would allow them to apply for family reunion visas before leaving their country of origin or transit.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: New Clause 52 means opposing the expansion of the family reunion criteria for asylum seekers. This would maintain the current rules that limit the eligibility of family members to spouses, partners and dependent children under 18.

Decision - The New Clause 52 would soften immigration and borders by making it easier for asylum seekers to join their relatives in the UK without having to risk their lives on dangerous journeys or resort to smugglers.

Sentiment - B
