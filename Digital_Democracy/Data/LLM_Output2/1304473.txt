Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Trade Bill, which deals with the UK's trade policy after Brexit. The main issue is whether the UK should sign trade deals with countries that commit genocide.

For - Voting for the motion means supporting the government's position that Parliament should have more scrutiny over trade deals with countries that face credible reports of genocide, but not giving a judicial role to a committee of former judges.

Against - Voting against the motion means supporting the amendment from Lord Alton, which would give a committee of former judges the power to make preliminary determinations of genocide and trigger a debate on any trade deal with such a country.

Decision - Voting for the motion is associated with stimulus and the free market, because it implies that the UK is willing to pursue trade deals with countries that may be committing genocide, as long as there is no judicial finding of genocide. This could be seen as prioritizing economic interests over human rights concerns.

Sentiment - A
