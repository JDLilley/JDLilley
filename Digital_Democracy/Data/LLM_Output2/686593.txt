Summary - The text file is a record of a debate in the House of Commons on the EU-Canada trade agreement (CETA) and the proposals for its signing, provisional application and conclusion. The House agreed to approve the documents by a large majority.

For - Voting for means supporting CETA as a progressive and beneficial trade deal that eliminates tariffs, defends geographical indications, improves access to services and protects labour rights, environment and sustainable development.

Against - Voting against means opposing CETA as a threat to democracy, public services, food safety, animal welfare and environmental standards. It also means rejecting the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism as unfair and undemocratic.

Decision - Voting for is associated with stimulus and the free market, as it promotes trade liberalisation, economic growth, competitiveness and innovation. It also reflects a pro-EU stance and a commitment to multilateralism.

Sentiment - A
