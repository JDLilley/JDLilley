Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on the Data Protection Bill, which aims to update the UK's data protection laws and align them with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. The debate covers various amendments and new clauses proposed by different MPs, as well as the Government's response.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division: Report Stage Amdt 5 means supporting an amendment that would require the Government to establish a public inquiry into data protection breaches by the media, as recommended by Lord Justice Leveson. This would ensure that the victims of press intrusion and hacking get justice and that the media are held accountable for their actions.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division: Report Stage Amdt 5 means opposing an amendment that would require the Government to establish a public inquiry into data protection breaches by the media, as recommended by Lord Justice Leveson. This would be a waste of public resources and a threat to press freedom, as the media have already been subject to extensive investigations and reforms, and there are existing mechanisms for redress and regulation.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division: Report Stage Amdt 5 is associated with ethical considerations, regulation, and tradition, in the context of Standards & Technology. This is because it reflects a concern for the privacy rights of individuals and the adherence to the data protection legislation, as well as a respect for the recommendations of a previous inquiry that was established by a cross-party consensus.

Sentiment - B
