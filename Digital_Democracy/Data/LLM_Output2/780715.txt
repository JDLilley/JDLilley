Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Finance Bill, which deals with tax reforms. The debate focuses on the issue of non-domiciled individuals and offshore trusts, and whether they should be subject to more scrutiny and taxation.

For - Voting for the new clause 2 means supporting a review of the impact of the government's changes to the taxation of non-domiciled individuals and offshore trusts, which the opposition claims are unfair and ineffective in tackling tax avoidance and evasion.

Against - Voting against the new clause 2 means opposing a review of the government's changes to the taxation of non-domiciled individuals and offshore trusts, which the government defends as reasonable and progressive in raising more revenue from wealthy foreigners who live or invest in the UK.

Decision - Voting for the new clause 2 is associated with austerity and regulation, as it implies a desire to increase tax revenues from non-domiciled individuals and offshore trusts, and to tighten the rules and enforcement around them.

Sentiment - B
