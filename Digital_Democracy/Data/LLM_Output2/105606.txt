Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on various amendments to the Children and Families Bill, which aim to protect children from tobacco and nicotine products and exposure to second-hand smoke.

For - Voting 'Ayes' means supporting the amendments, which would give the Government powers to introduce standardised packaging for tobacco products, ban the sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s, create an offence of proxy purchasing of tobacco, and prohibit smoking in private vehicles carrying children[1].

Against - Voting 'Noes' means opposing the amendments, which would restrict the freedom of choice and expression of smokers, impose unnecessary burdens on retailers and manufacturers, create unenforceable and ineffective laws, and interfere with the private sphere of families.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' is not directly associated with either greater or less spending on and provision of welfare and social housing. However, it could be argued that by reducing the uptake and prevalence of smoking among children and young people, the amendments would have long-term benefits for public health and reduce the costs of treating smoking-related diseases, which could free up resources for other social policies.

Sentiment - C
