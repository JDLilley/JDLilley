Summary - The text file is a transcript of a parliamentary debate on a bill that ends free movement of EU citizens to the UK and introduces a points-based immigration system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the Lords.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division means rejecting Lords amendment 4, which would ensure safe refugee family reunion routes after the end of the UK-EU transition period[1]. The Government argues that the amendment is not practical and that they intend to reform the asylum system to make it firm but fair.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division means supporting Lords amendment 4, which would protect the right of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to join family members in the UK[2]. The Opposition argues that the amendment is necessary to uphold the principle of family unity and to provide legal pathways for vulnerable children[3].

Decision - The motion to disagree with Lords amendment 4 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would remove a legal route for refugees to reunite with their families in the UK and make it harder for unaccompanied children to seek safety and protection.

Sentiment - A
