Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the UK Parliament on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which aims to reform the asylum and immigration system. The debate covers various amendments proposed by the House of Lords and the Government's response to them.

For - Voting for (Ayes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 26 means supporting the Government's plan to create a new offence of knowingly arriving in the UK without permission. The Government argues that this will deter illegal entry and break the business model of criminal smugglers.

Against - Voting against (Noes) in the division: Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 26 means opposing the Government's plan to create a new offence of knowingly arriving in the UK without permission. The opponents argue that this will criminalise vulnerable people seeking protection and violate international law and human rights.

Decision - The Motion to disagree with Lords Amendment 26 would tighten immigration and borders, as it would introduce a new criminal sanction for those who enter the UK irregularly, regardless of their reasons or circumstances. It would also create a two-tier system of asylum based on the mode of arrival, which could undermine the principle of refugee protection.

Sentiment - A
