Summary - The text file is a transcript of a debate in the House of Commons on the Health and Care Bill, which aims to improve the integration and accountability of health and social care services in England. The debate focuses on various amendments proposed by the Lords and the Government.

For - Voting 'Ayes' in the division means supporting amendment 30, which would require each integrated care board to produce an annual community rehabilitation plan covering the provision of physical and psychological rehabilitation services. This would ensure that rehabilitation is given priority across health and social care sectors.

Against - Voting 'Noes' in the division means rejecting amendment 30, which would impose an additional duty on integrated care boards that may not be necessary or appropriate for their local circumstances. This would allow more flexibility and autonomy for integrated care boards to decide how to provide rehabilitation services.

Decision - Voting 'Aye' in the division is associated with investment in public health and improving standards of care, in the context of Health & Healthcare. This is because rehabilitation is an essential component of health and social care that can improve the quality of life and outcomes for patients with various conditions and disabilities.

Sentiment - A
